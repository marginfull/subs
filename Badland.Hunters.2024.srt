2
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,359
{\an8}So-yeon.

3
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,075
{\an8}Right.

4
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,829
{\an8}So-yeon.

5
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,206
{\an8}So-yeon.

6
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,961
{\an8}I'm gonna try again.

7
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,713
{\an8}I swear you're gonna live, okay?

8
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,232
Gi-su!

9
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,316
Yang Gi-su!

10
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,156
Stop right now.

11
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,533
Just let So-yeon go.

12
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,994
I have to revive her.

13
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,454
She'll be dead if we don't act now.

14
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,874
- Don't make me shoot.
- Gi-su, wait.

15
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,253
You've taken over a hundred lives
with these horrific experiments.

16
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,380
This isn't what So-yeon would have wanted.

17
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,301
Your daughter's not going to come back.
Let her go.

18
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,179
I can't.
I've finally got it figured it out now.

19
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,431
I swear, I know. Look at me.

20
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,350
I already injected myself with it.
I'm living proof.

21
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,519
Now we can save So-yeon.

22
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,981
Yang Gi-su!

23
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,157
No, you can't.

24
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,117
Don't touch her!

25
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,035
Get him out of here.

26
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,913
You're gonna kill her!

27
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,916
You're gonna kill So-yeon!

28
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,503
Huh?

29
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,929
EMERGENCY ALERT POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE
ABOVE 5.0 ON THE RICHTER SCALE DETECTED

30
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:46,893
Oh no...

31
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,103
So-yeon.

32
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,588
No!

33
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,662
BADLAND HUNTERS

34
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,983
Yes! Yes.

35
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,278
Die, die, die, die. Come on, die.

36
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,001
Oh shit!

37
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,756
Oh God, it's gonna fucking kill me.

38
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,519
Oh God! I need help! I need help!

39
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,645
Get back!

40
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,605
Get back!

41
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,086
Hey, come here.

42
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,881
Hey, I was about to finish that off, man.

43
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,675
Who cares who kills it?
Come on, let's get this out of here.

44
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,761
I'm hungry now.

45
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,194
Oh my.

46
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,446
Huh?

47
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:12,283
Grandma, I told you to let me know
if you needed me to do anything.

48
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,285
I'm fine, Su-na.

49
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,704
I just stepped outside
to get a little fresh air.

50
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,540
Come on,
you know your knees need rest.

51
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,709
Why don't you go take a seat over there?

52
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,920
Hmph.

53
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,799
I can't even remember
the last time that it rained here.

54
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,427
Oh God.

55
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,139
There really isn't any drinkable water,
is there?

56
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,395
Maybe we should... find ourselves a car

57
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,023
and go live in the Bus District.
What do you think, Su-na?

58
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,902
Well, um,

59
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,197
I think I'd rather live
right here with you.

60
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,118
Just because there are more people there
doesn't mean it's safer.

61
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,121
There was that time
the cannibals tried taking us.

62
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,917
They used to be kind before the drought,
and now it's just different.

63
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,879
You know, not everybody in the world
is evil like that.

64
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:12,760
Well, most people
that I've seen are like that though.

65
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,013
Su-na.

66
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,684
Listen, this is what I think, okay?

67
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,146
In this life, it's best to believe
that you reap whatever you sow.

68
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,609
It might seem like everyone's evil,
but if you embrace the good in the world,

69
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,279
you're going to find people that are kind.

70
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,447
That, I'm sure of.

71
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,325
Grandma, you trust too much.

72
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,495
I'm sure before the earthquake
that was true.

73
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,081
I guess you're right.

74
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,750
But I don't remember what that was like.

75
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,380
Oh, that's right.

76
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,674
We're going to
the Bus District today, actually.

77
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,802
- Nam San must be back from his hunt.
- Mm-hmm.

78
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,016
I've had enough
of all this dirty water.

79
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,852
We haven't gotten a drop of rain
for how many months now?

80
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,521
This is nothing.

81
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,898
Last year, we had a drought
for over six months.

82
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,587
Hey! Hey!

83
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,755
We've got meat here!

84
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,797
Hurry up!

85
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,467
Alright, alright, line up everyone,
right here!

86
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,135
Have your bartering pieces ready to go.

87
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,428
Hey, sir!

88
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,472
It's... it's a single-file line.

89
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,310
Alright.

90
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,395
Rubber boots.

91
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,897
- Nam San.
- Fine, whatever.

92
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,651
Next.

93
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,612
Oh, no, no.

94
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,739
- No, thanks.
- Looks fine to me.

95
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,663
Alright. Here.

96
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,709
Ah! My God!

97
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,471
This should be enough

98
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,391
to get that section.

99
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,184
The entire tail.

100
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,687
The whole thing.

101
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,356
Yeah, but you can't eat that. No, thanks.

102
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,903
Once this situation dies down and things
start to get better, this will all be...

103
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,531
Oh wow.
You're really optimistic, lady. Hmm?

104
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,035
I mean, it's been over three years
since the whole world ended.

105
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,745
It's about time you accept it.

106
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,790
Hey, here, at least take this.
Here you go. Here.

107
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,544
We really shouldn't be doing this,
but no one's looking.

108
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,671
Do I cook it?

109
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,631
It's poisonous. You better.

110
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,603
What's this?

111
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,646
- Rice.
- Rice?

112
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,567
Oh, thank you.

113
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,111
- Hey there.
- Su-na!

114
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,948
- Hello, how are you?
- Oh, there you are, Su-na. How's it going?

115
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:21,866
Hello.

116
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,160
Ah, man, you didn't have to come
all the way out here.

117
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,162
I could have just stopped by
on my way home.

118
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,498
- She must be exhausted.
- Oh, cut it out. We need to eat, don't we?

119
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,668
Anyway, Su-na owes her life
to Nam San, after all.

120
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,880
I can't believe that was three years ago.

121
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,550
I feel bad. You've given us
your hospitality for so long. Here.

122
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,261
You didn't have to. Thank you so much.

123
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,098
Su-na has grown into a fine young woman.

124
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,475
Ah, thanks a lot.

125
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,352
Right. Well, uh, take some meat.

126
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,729
- This here.
- Su-na.

127
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,856
I caught this crocodile, you know.

128
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,692
Mm-hmm? Nam San didn't catch this one?

129
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,527
Hey, seriously? Huh?

130
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,072
I wanted to trade this in.

131
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,701
Oh, I'm guessing
you painted this. Let's see it.

132
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,411
Wow...

133
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,789
Masterpiece. It's amazing.

134
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,999
- An original?
- Yes.

135
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,585
Have one for me?
I'm out there hunting too, right?

136
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,588
Oh, we should head out now.
There are people behind us waiting.

137
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,256
- Mm.
- Sorry about that.

138
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,675
- We'll get going now.
- Goodbye. See you soon.

139
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,177
- We'll be on our way now.
- See ya.

140
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,094
Next.

141
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,661
They practically set up
a fucking village here, huh?

142
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,329
Living hard, I see. Damn!

143
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,749
Alright, listen.

144
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,876
Bus District folks, listen up.

145
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,840
All of us are from the, uh,
the Jamsil Police Station, okay?

146
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,175
Huh? Here's the proof right here.
Take a look.

147
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,429
Uh, so long as you guys cooperate with us,

148
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,973
nobody will get hurt.

149
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:09,890
Okay?

150
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,186
Fuck me, just say something.

151
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,397
Uh, well, as to why we're here, then,

152
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,315
uh, here it is. Here we go.

153
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,986
We are bounty hunters
searching for a notorious villain.

154
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,863
We've been on his trail and...

155
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,780
WANTED

156
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,241
...found that this neighborhood
reeks of his scent.

157
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:31,120
So I'd like to ask everybody
for your cooperation right now. Huh?

158
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,830
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

159
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,373
Yeah. That guy looks just like him.

160
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,584
- See that?
- Oh, he does!

161
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,793
Alright, take him away.

162
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,461
Oh God!

163
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,006
It's not me!

164
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,510
Hey, hey, hey, grab that woman
who's wearing all the gold.

165
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,265
Hey!

166
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,058
I'm a lady though. Wait.

167
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,061
Yeah, I know. Uh, this guy <i>is</i> a lady.

168
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,396
He's a lady?

169
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,314
Oh!

170
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,150
Hey, hey, you, you, you.

171
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,695
Let's go.

172
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,697
Hey, let me go.

173
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,159
Strong guy, eh?

174
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,660
You fuck.

175
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,996
Are you even a real cop?

176
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,001
Oh jeez...

177
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,422
We warned you.
Cooperate, or you'll get hurt.

178
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,804
Whoa!

179
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,223
Wow!

180
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,309
How old are you?

181
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,353
What's it matter to you?

182
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,355
I'm just glad to see you.

183
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,107
Everybody your age has
basically disappeared, that's all.

184
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,943
You smell awful. Stay away.

185
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,154
- Come on, Grandma.
- Let's go, let's go.

186
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,115
Ah, this bitch. Come here!

187
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,117
- That son of a...
- What did you say?

188
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,786
Hey, you, get off her...

189
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,538
- You old hag!
- You son of a bitch!

190
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,292
Su-na, are you alright?

191
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,175
Hey, come here,
you little bastard!

192
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,439
Hey, hold it.

193
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,316
Go.

194
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,818
Move.

195
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,700
The hell do you think you're doing?

196
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,667
Come on! Come on!

197
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,052
Die!

198
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,640
Hey, that hurt.

199
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,319
So are you in charge, then?

200
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,822
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't even know who the boss is.

201
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,073
Come on. Just say who it is.

202
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,867
Uh, T... T... T...

203
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,326
Tiger. Tiger's my boss.

204
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,454
Tiger? So he's still alive, huh?

205
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,669
Hey, where'd you get this water?

206
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,338
- A... at an apartment. An apartment.
- An apartment?

207
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,466
- Yes, sir.
- I've spent a lot of time around here.

208
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,842
Never come across any apartments.

209
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,135
It's the truth.

210
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,596
I... it's just far from here
and surrounded by tall trees,

211
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,601
so it can just be hard to see, yeah.
There's clean water at that apartment.

212
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:44,271
Listen, if you come here again,
I'm going to have to kill you, okay?

213
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,814
Yes, yes, of course.

214
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,357
And Tiger should know that.

215
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,275
Yes.

216
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,740
Okay, what should...
wh... who should I say said that?

217
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,534
Nam San.

218
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,579
Oh, you're... you're Nam San. Oh...

219
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,955
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

220
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,583
Understood. Hey, hey. Go, get up, go.

221
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,751
So sorry, I'm sorry.

222
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,003
Go! Get the fuck... Go, go, go!

223
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,171
Drive, drive!

224
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,009
You alright?

225
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,928
You alright? You okay?

226
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,638
Oh, yes, yes. Are you?

227
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,599
I think so.

228
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,484
Cutie pie...

229
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:36,990
Nam San.

230
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,753
By the way, all that talk earlier
might not have been complete nonsense.

231
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,296
What talk?

232
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,385
Remember? They said there's an apartment
where you can get clean water.

233
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,304
I heard it really exists.

234
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,057
And people are dying to get over there.

235
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,935
I heard there's a ton of residents,

236
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,396
and that it's heaven on earth.

237
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,817
How about you go check it out?

238
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,610
I mean, I'm just curious about it.

239
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,447
And besides,
you don't get to just go there.

240
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,117
The "chosen few" are
the only ones allowed in.

241
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,997
Huh? Who are these jerks?

242
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,171
- Su-na!
- Hey.

243
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,339
Who are you all?

244
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,010
Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

245
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,428
They're not bad people.

246
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,139
Uh, she says she's a teacher.

247
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,891
It's okay, Nam San.

248
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,559
What kind of teacher?

249
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,061
Hello, gentlemen. Nice to meet you.

250
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,690
We actually have started
a safe haven in Seoul.

251
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,234
I'm the leader of our organization's
volunteer group, and...

252
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,237
I think that's the same place
I mentioned before.

253
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,740
But, uh, why us though?

254
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,034
Uh, you see,

255
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,038
we're prioritizing the safety
of families with children below 20.

256
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,833
We believe that protecting our youth
is the only way to save humanity.

257
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,335
Su-na, if you come with us,

258
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,630
your grandmother will live comfortably
for the rest of her life.

259
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,050
We have clean water
and plenty of food in storage.

260
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,801
You have clean water?

261
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,137
Oh my God, that's incredible.

262
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,724
If that place is so amazing,
then it's gonna be a target for the gangs.

263
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,392
You ever stop to consider that?

264
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,398
There's a security force
of armed ex-military soldiers,

265
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,610
which means that the gangs
couldn't possibly make a move on us.

266
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,780
Well, in that case,
can the two of them come with us?

267
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,281
They're like family to me.

268
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,033
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,662
We can only take
direct family members right now.

270
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,000
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but I need your answer soon.

271
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:52,918
For Su-na's sake,

272
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,754
I hope that you're going to make
the right choice here.

273
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,716
And unfortunately, we're going to have to
find someone else if you say no.

274
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,261
The thing is, ma'am,
my grandmother is not well,

275
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,638
and she won't be able to walk
that whole way.

276
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,140
We have medical staff
standing by at the halfway point

277
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,310
to ensure everyone on our watch
arrives safely. Don't worry.

278
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,688
She's right. Su-na, we should go.

279
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,773
You should go.
It has to be better than this.

280
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,192
Right. You deserve that.

281
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,615
I'll come visit you.

282
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,537
Okay.

283
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,997
You too, Nam San.

284
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,623
Will you also visit us?

285
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,208
I will, I promise.

286
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,128
Just a second, Grandma.

287
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,506
Thank you so much

288
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,426
for all your help and support, Nam San.

289
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,761
Don't mention it. Take care of yourself.

290
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,306
Safe travels.

291
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,444
It's, uh, just a practice sketch.

292
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,029
Oh wow!

293
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,077
We should hurry along now.
It'll be harder to walk after sundown.

294
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,247
- Oh, um, Grandma, come on.
- Okay.

295
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,143
When'd she get a good-enough look
to draw me like this?

296
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,901
Hyung, Su-na has a crush on me,
don't you think?

297
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,402
Hmm, nah, I don't think so.

298
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,615
Man, what am I gonna do

299
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,408
now that Su-na's gone?

300
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,119
This place is way too dangerous
for her to live in.

301
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,539
Things like what happened today
happen too often.

302
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,418
I mean, you could just keep her safe,
like how you did today.

303
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,339
How would I do that?

304
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,424
I couldn't even protect my own daughter.

305
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,884
Sheesh, man!

306
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,179
Look, there you go again
with that kind of talk.

307
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,772
But Su-na sure does look
a lot like your daughter.

308
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,901
Oh!

309
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,570
If you got married and adopted me,

310
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,572
wouldn't that mean
we could also live there?

311
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,573
Huh?

312
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,450
What do you think about the jewelry girl?

313
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,369
- Hey.
- Seriously.

314
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,205
I know the world might have ended,
but I still have standards.

315
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,792
You just want me to be alone forever.

316
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,669
You know how couples
take after each other?

317
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,172
You're pretty similar. And that complexion
would look great with the right makeup.

318
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,383
Hey, she stuffed that snake in her nose.

319
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,467
Who does that?

320
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,468
That's enough.

321
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,553
Okay? Enough.

322
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,352
Where you going?

323
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,730
Ugh, you're running your mouth too much,
so I'm getting some air.

324
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,232
Going on a night hunt?

325
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,151
- That's right.
- Let me come with you.

326
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,078
Grandma, are you alright?

327
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,246
Uh-huh.

328
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,791
- Yes, dear, don't you worry about me.
- Watch your step here.

329
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,646
Oh, don't worry.
They're part of our volunteer group.

330
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,356
Okay.

331
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,002
These are
the Western Region families joining us.

332
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,420
Oh, thank you.

333
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,881
Thank you for making it
all the way out here, everyone.

334
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,090
It's a pleasure.

335
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,302
Now follow me this way,
please, and be careful.

336
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,854
Um...

337
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,856
I'm Lee Ju-ye.

338
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,441
I'm 18. And you?

339
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,320
Uh, Han Su-na.

340
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:31,988
And I'm also 18.

341
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,406
Oh. Wanna be friends?

342
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,243
Yeah, sure.

343
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,244
We're friends now.

344
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,580
I haven't had a friend
who's my age in forever.

345
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,998
Yeah, me too.

346
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,210
There was nobody my age
in my neighborhood either.

347
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,337
And where were you living?

348
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,800
I lived in a tent near the Bus District.
I've been staying with my grandma here.

349
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,468
Oh.

350
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,136
Nice to meet you, Ju-ye.

351
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:00,225
My mom and dad made us live underground
'cause it wasn't safe outside.

352
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,852
I'm sure that was hard.

353
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,397
It wasn't so bad, actually.

354
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,901
But the bugs and rats
would crawl all over my body.

355
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,822
So I had to keep moving
my arms and legs, you know,

356
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,116
so they didn't bite down,
thinking I was dead.

357
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,576
That part was pretty rough.

358
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,706
At least that stuff is all over now.

359
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,250
Mm-hmm.
I heard the place is amazing.

360
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,669
First thing I'm gonna do
when we get there is take a shower.

361
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,505
It still feels like the bugs are
clinging to my skin right now.

362
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,806
I wonder
if Su-na's made it there by now.

363
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,392
God, I wish I could go there with her.

364
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,023
Man, I really don't wanna
have to let her go.

365
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,400
You know we can go see her
when we visit, right?

366
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,484
No.

367
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,570
The jewelry woman.

368
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,823
I always wanted that kind of mother.

369
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,410
- Alright, you little... Come here!
- Hey, okay, I get it!

370
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,370
Careful.

371
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,042
Oh God! Oh my...

372
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,377
Oh my God! Grandma, are you okay?

373
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,296
Oh God.

374
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,214
Let's stop here, okay?

375
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,552
Why don't we escort Su-na's grandmother
and your grandfather

376
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,305
to the medical station
I mentioned earlier on?

377
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,724
It's dangerous terrain
from this point forward,

378
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,143
and we wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.

379
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,271
Mr. Oh and Mr. Choi
will safely escort you there.

380
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,106
Thank you so much.

381
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,692
Yes, thank you
for everything you're doing.

382
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,777
Ma'am,

383
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,738
just please take care of my grandma, okay?

384
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,115
Of course. We'll take care of her.

385
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,370
- Mr. Choi.
- I'll look after your grandma.

386
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,001
- Please come with me, sir.
- Thank you so much.

387
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,421
- Slowly.
- I-I'll see you tomorrow, Dad.

388
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,840
- Careful, sweetheart.
- I hope he'll be alright.

389
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,842
Alright,
let's move on now, then.

390
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,933
Su-na, you just keep going. It'll be okay.

391
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,324
- Oh sh... shit. Shit.
- Freaking out again.

392
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,450
Looks like a bust.

393
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,660
Let's check the snare.

394
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,329
Okay.

395
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,596
These vehicles belong to us.
Everyone get in,

396
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,182
and we'll get off our feet
for the rest of the way.

397
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,934
Excuse me.

398
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,313
If the cars were here, then Grandma
could have just come with all of us.

399
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,940
Okay, we'll wait, then.

400
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,902
What's a few more hours of waiting
when everyone's been walking all night?

401
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,739
Isn't that right, everyone?

402
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,699
- Ma.
- Huh?

403
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,160
- I'm thirsty.
- We don't have any water right now.

404
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,703
Hang in there, okay?

405
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,623
Oh, what do we do?

406
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,417
Su-na,

407
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,170
we'll send a car
for your grandmother tomorrow.

408
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,463
Don't worry about her.

409
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,132
Let's get going now.

410
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,759
Get in, everyone.

411
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,307
- Oh God, thank you.
- Oh my, you must be exhausted.

412
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,190
Don't worry about your grandma too much.
I'm sure she's okay.

413
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,358
- Mm.
- We need to do a head count.

414
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,749
To think there's still people doing
such fine work in these trying times...

415
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:56,377
Yes, he's right.
I feel bad you're going out of your way.

416
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,754
Oh, don't mention it.

417
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,590
Alright, it's time to stop now.

418
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,145
I don't see the facility anywhere though.

419
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,647
Down there.

420
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,486
Huh?

421
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:23,738
Is that Grandma?

422
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,533
Grandma!

423
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,095
Grandma! Wake up, Grandma!

424
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,128
What's with these freaks?

425
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,936
What the hell?

426
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,661
Let's go, you asshole.

427
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:02,879
Why did you kill her?

428
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,257
- They were both useless.
- You fucking son of a bitch!

429
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,258
Oh my God...

430
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:08,927
Su-na...

431
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:10,970
Where is Su-na?!

432
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,910
Fucking die!

433
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,840
Ji-wan!

434
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,886
Who are you?

435
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,569
Hyung, we have to go right now.
Su-na's in danger.

436
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:13,616
Not yet. We have to pay our respects.
Are you just gonna leave her like that?

437
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,690
We're almost there, everyone.

438
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,900
Please gather your personal items.

439
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,537
You came here to see me?

440
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,749
That's right.

441
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,417
I need your help, Nam San.

442
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,628
I need to rescue my associates
and the residents of the apartment.

443
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,631
All right, so my question is, why'd
you come to us, of all people, for help?

444
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,051
And who the hell were those guys?
And the apartment?

445
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,927
Hey. Mind your business.

446
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,221
I really need you.

447
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,185
I've never seen
anything like this before.

448
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,770
You need to chop their heads off?

449
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,896
Exactly.

450
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,983
What are they anyway?

451
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,322
<i>My name is Lee Eun-ho.</i>

452
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,116
<i>I used to be
an air force sergeant, special ops.</i>

453
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,828
We're going down to look for survivors.

454
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,371
Yes, Sergeant.

455
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,880
<i>We were watching everything
from the sky</i>

456
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,715
<i>on the day of the great earthquake.</i>

457
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,135
<i>During our search for survivors,</i>

458
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,138
<i>we came across an apartment
that somehow hadn't crumbled down.</i>

459
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,433
<i>So our unit struck an aquifer there,</i>

460
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,937
<i>and with the survivors,
we did everything in our power</i>

461
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,647
<i>to get the apartment up and running.</i>

462
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,399
<i>But then one day,</i>

463
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,528
<i>that man came to us.</i>

464
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,364
<i>Yang Gi-su.</i>

465
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,283
<i>The only doctor we'd seen
since the tragedy.</i>

466
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,662
<i>Being a doctor,
he was invaluable to our cause.</i>

467
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,998
<i>But one day, he showed his true colors.</i>

468
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:32,547
Dr. Yang, I wanted to check on something.
Some parents have been complaining

469
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,925
that their children have yet to return
ever since they came to see you.

470
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,009
What have you done?

471
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,305
Lee Eun-ho, what's going on?

472
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,349
Well, explain yourself.

473
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,434
Sergeant Kwon,

474
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,605
don't you think it's time
we let Sergeant Eun-ho in on our secret?

475
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,149
Eun-ho,

476
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,109
the world as we know it is doomed.

477
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,695
We need to...

478
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,407
place all our faith in Dr. Yang.

479
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,701
I merely gave him some advice.

480
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,870
I also gave him a little gift as well.

481
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,921
- Why did you kill him?
- Look.

482
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,299
This is the breakthrough
we were waiting for.

483
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,400
Sergeant Lee Eun-ho?

484
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,110
Think about it.

485
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,737
Take a good look at me.

486
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,363
How...

487
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,825
how do you think I was able to survive
that horrible earthquake?

488
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,246
I once went two, three months or so
without having any water.

489
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,166
This is the future of mankind.

490
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,794
This apartment won't last long,
and everyone's doomed.

491
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,339
Failure to embrace this change
will kill everyone.

492
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,301
And I'll help you all survive.

493
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,678
No, you're insane.

494
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,473
- Where are the children?
- Get her out.

495
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,308
- What have you done with them?
- Now, now.

496
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,728
Wait! Let me go!

497
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,733
Shit!

498
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,069
Lee Eun-ho!

499
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,829
It seems Yang Gi-su has been conducting
strange experiments on humans.

500
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,458
They've become those creatures
because of what he's doing.

501
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,335
- If you help me, then...
- Hey.

502
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:35,795
Listen.

503
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,797
Su-na is all I care about.

504
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,510
And I'm gonna kill you
if you even try anything.

505
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:43,928
Got it?

506
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,983
We have over 30 families
living here right now,

507
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,026
and we even provide our residents
with electricity,

508
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,862
thanks to the new solar panels
that we installed.

509
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,785
Are we going to live here?

510
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,082
Is that lettuce? I even see some tomatoes.

511
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,297
WELCOME, NEW RESIDENTS

512
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,173
WELCOME TO THE NEW FUTURE OF HUMANITY

513
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,801
Make way, make way!

514
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,390
Dr. Yang is about to come out now.

515
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,272
Hello, everyone.

516
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,149
I'm in charge of this place.

517
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,942
Yang Gi-su, nice to meet you.

518
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,780
Welcome, everyone.

519
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,870
You all must have
gone through terrible things out there,

520
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,372
where the world is brutal and unsafe.

521
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,541
You've all had to endure
the worst out there,

522
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,585
where the barbarians roam free.

523
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,670
But now... now you don't have to worry.

524
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,672
We will be, uh, providing you

525
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,800
with clean water
and provisions, of course.

526
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,929
And we'll keep you all safe
from the outside world.

527
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,308
Right, get some water for them
if you would.

528
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,772
That's clean water

529
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,774
that we purified ourselves
in this apartment.

530
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,318
Yeah.

531
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,946
Uh, wait, sir.

532
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,492
My grandma is gonna be arriving soon.
Can I please have another water?

533
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,536
Thanks so much.

534
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:15,871
They've been mercilessly taking children,
just like they took Su-na.

535
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,873
Can you imagine
what he must be doing to them?

536
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,292
Those sons of bitches! Oh shit!

537
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,585
We have to go right now.

538
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,046
- Su-na's in danger!
- Do you have a death wish or something?

539
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,590
Charging in won't do us any good.

540
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,970
Security is much tighter
than you might expect.

541
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,139
They've been shooting
everybody who trespasses.

542
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,725
I'll kick things off by taking care
of all the guards at the main gate

543
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,019
and keeping them distracted come daybreak.

544
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,105
If the two of you
get to the underground prison

545
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,606
and rescue my associates,

546
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,651
they'll be able to help us.

547
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:49,196
Hey, why should we believe
your associates or whatever?

548
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,825
Ugh, so disrespectful,
running your mouth again.

549
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,493
How old are you?

550
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,537
I'm 18, fuck you very much, lady.

551
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,705
You better watch your mouth.

552
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,792
- Let go!
- Hey, calm down, you little lovebirds.

553
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,961
Let's think this over.

554
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,310
Amen, yeah.

555
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,815
Hey, hey!

556
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,901
Sir, I took care of all of them.

557
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,528
- Go at it, you stupid idiot!
- Fight!

558
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,405
- Hurry up and fight!
- Hey, hey!

559
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,948
- Come on!
- Hey.

560
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,658
Get 'em out of there!

561
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,330
Come on, bro. Wanna see
your wife's blood spurt everywhere?

562
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,247
Do something!

563
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,084
Let's go, let's go!

564
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,895
Oh shit!

565
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,440
- Bitch!
- Shit, man, we lost again?!

566
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,947
Hey, Pung-gi.

567
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,783
Have anything left to bet?

568
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,452
You limp-dick,
chrome-dome, lard-ass shithead,

569
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,287
can't you see there's one left?

570
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,757
Wow, to think in prison, I saved your life

571
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,134
just so you could disrespect me.

572
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,053
- You show some respect.
- Fuck them up!

573
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:42,893
Come here!

574
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,355
Fuck!

575
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,566
Tiger!

576
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,109
What, asshole?

577
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,654
Damn it!

578
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,490
Hey, fucking kill them all!

579
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,757
Alright, wait!

580
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,970
Tiger around here?

581
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,556
Well, look who it is.

582
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,142
Nam San, it's been a while.

583
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,561
Oh, there's the potato face I remember.

584
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,064
Sir, that's the asshole.
Watch out. He's a beast.

585
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,901
Thanks to you,
my boxing career ended, and I got screwed.

586
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:36,363
I've been itching for revenge,
and you just walked right into your grave.

587
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,074
Hey, I came here to ask you a question.

588
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,076
I changed my mind after that tone.

589
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,121
- Should I beat your ass now?
- There's no ring around here.

590
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,416
Street fighting's way out of your league,
you ass!

591
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,627
Hey, Pung-gi.

592
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,631
If you bring down that gorilla,
I'll give you half the slaves.

593
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,590
Half?

594
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,135
After I kill him,
you're next, you fat loser.

595
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,346
Now kill that man!

596
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,629
Shit, man...

597
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,624
Stop, stop!

598
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,168
Damn it! Ugh, it hurts!

599
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:19,508
- Oh God, it hurts!
- Get up. Come on.

600
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,135
Hey, let's go!

601
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,553
Wait!

602
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,596
Come on!

603
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:30,185
Oh... oh God, it hurts so much, oh...

604
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,324
Hello, how are you?

605
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,911
Uh, can you tell me
when my grandma will be arriving?

606
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:48,954
Your grandma?

607
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,956
What do you mean?

608
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,250
We sent a car for them earlier today,

609
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,544
so she should be here at dinner.

610
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,672
Don't worry about it. Enjoy the sunshine.

611
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:00,883
Okay.

612
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,054
You sure are doing a lot
to please a child.

613
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,599
Children are the pathway to our future.

614
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,435
We have to keep them content.

615
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,230
Our real future is through Dr. Yang Gi-su.

616
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,148
Okay?

617
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,159
Today we're going to be announcing
the cumulative scores.

618
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,622
In first,

619
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,332
Kim Hak-yong.

620
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:37,294
Unit 604. Lee Gyu-yeon, unit 607.

621
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,755
Third place, Choi Ju-yeong, unit 601.

622
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,090
Fourth place, Jang Chang-su, unit 608.

623
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,801
Uh, ex... excuse me?

624
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,179
What grades is he talking about?
We're new here, so we don't know.

625
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,890
Whichever student gets the highest score,

626
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:53,060
they get to choose a unit
to live in with their family.

627
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,229
I'm so jealous of you.

628
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,190
My child places last every week.

629
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,400
Family members of the student
with the highest score

630
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,278
will be exempt from work
and also given a free meal pass.

631
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,240
Family members of Kim Hak-yong,
please step forward.

632
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,787
- Congratulations. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

633
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,623
Thank you, Doctor.

634
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,459
Do you think
that you can score the highest?

635
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,794
Of course!

636
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,547
The children are our hope!

637
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,966
The children are our future!

638
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,176
Everyone, please keep
your children strong,

639
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,678
and let's lift them all up!

640
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,231
Alright, everybody.
It's time to say your goodbyes.

641
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:42,568
As we mentioned before, all the students
will be living on the eighth floor.

642
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,194
- Huh?
- What?

643
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,071
You never mentioned that though.

644
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,407
Your grandmother has been told
all of this.

645
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,576
Maybe she forgot to say something to you?

646
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,035
Oh...

647
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,372
Does that mean that I won't live with her?

648
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,457
Will we have
any contact with Ju-ye at all?

649
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,837
I'll make sure you'll be able to see her
if you just schedule a meeting.

650
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,964
So we just need to make
an appointment with you?

651
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:04,965
Of course.

652
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,594
I'll get going now.
I'll score high for you.

653
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,095
Don't skip any meals, okay?

654
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,763
Okay, let's go.

655
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:15,267
- Please take good care of her.
- Right, take good care of her.

656
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,811
- See you later!
- As for the parents, please follow me.

657
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,522
- Gyu-rin, listen to your older brother.
- Okay.

658
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,108
- Han Seong-won, take good care of Gyu-rin.
- I will.

659
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,526
- Okay? Bye.
- This way.

660
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,153
Is this all I need to take?

661
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,680
This is the clean water
that our children drink.

662
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,392
Now, if you look here,
you'll see the steps we take

663
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,896
to filter the dirty water
and produce the potable water we drink.

664
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,773
The most precious resource we have.

665
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:09,863
Hyung!

666
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,156
They have guns here.

667
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:12,658
Okay.

668
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:18,038
Hey, I'm just curious.
Where'd you get the guns and the water?

669
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,915
The apartment, is that right, guys?

670
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,500
Huh?

671
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,252
You don't know?

672
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,170
Uh, do... do we...

673
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,588
do... do we know where we got it?

674
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,506
What?

675
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,133
Do you know or not?

676
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,135
Uh, I'm not... I'm not entirely sure.

677
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,679
Okay, take a nap, then.

678
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,558
Do you know?

679
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,643
I don't exactly...

680
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,936
Lights out.

681
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,647
You? You don't know?

682
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,564
No.

683
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:46,525
What about you?

684
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:47,776
- Uh...
- You don't know.

685
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,322
What about you? Do you know? No?

686
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,490
You don't, do you?

687
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,496
- Uh, you don't know about this.
- I do know, sir.

688
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,915
- Nope, no way.
- I go out to make these deals.

689
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,292
You're gonna need me around
to help you, Nam San.

690
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,266
Hey there.

691
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,310
Do you come down here every day to work?

692
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,440
Yeah, this is our daily work.

693
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,783
They have a monopoly on all the water.

694
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,493
We're talking really clean shit.

695
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,203
They just hoard it for themselves?

696
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,205
That gives them their authority.

697
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,584
They've been living comfortably
while all the gangs, ours included,

698
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,419
bring them anything in exchange for water.

699
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,920
What do you give to them in return?

700
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,338
People.

701
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,050
In the beginning, they were okay
with us bringing in whoever,

702
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,844
but nowadays, they've just
been asking for children.

703
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,554
- Teenagers.
- Why children?

704
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:58,597
I don't know about that.

705
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,932
You didn't know what was happening
and sold them people?

706
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,810
- Whoa, chill!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Relax, relax.

707
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,187
Then in the Bus District,

708
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,190
when your boys tried to nab Su-na,
it was... that was for this?

709
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,358
- Yeah.
- Oh, you son of a bitch!

710
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,359
Hey, come on, come on.

711
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,612
How come you kids have such short tempers?

712
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:14,988
- Hey, come on.
- Let me go.

713
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,907
Relax, let it go.

714
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,326
We had to make a living somehow.

715
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,329
Okay, so how did you
get past their snipers, then?

716
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,705
You can get in on...

717
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,167
...delivery days.

718
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,836
- They make sure deliveries go through.
- On delivery days.

719
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,756
You must be tired from all that talking.
Get some rest.

720
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,884
Well, I feel like I'm okay, actually.

721
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:36,927
Just catch some Zs.

722
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,811
Mr. Choi has taken care
of the children's grandparents.

723
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,480
Uh, our newest children are
Han Su-na and Lee Ju-ye,

724
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,357
both 18-year-old girls.

725
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,859
Uh, accounting for our two new recruits,

726
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,236
that puts us at 19 total,

727
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,280
plus they're much healthier
than we had expected.

728
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,198
I see.

729
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,367
- Take good care of those two, then.
- Okay.

730
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,286
And make sure enough time has passed
since they've had clean water.

731
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,164
- You know what to do.
- I'll make the preparations right away.

732
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,166
I'll visit them later this afternoon.

733
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,251
Alright, get to it.

734
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,255
- You've got a little something there.
- Let's go.

735
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,433
Hello, everyone.

736
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,938
Here, this way.

737
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,023
Stand here.

738
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,734
Attention, and bow.

739
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,528
Nice to meet you.

740
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,823
Alright, everybody.

741
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,286
We have some new friends today.
Ju-ye, go ahead and introduce yourself.

742
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,996
Oh, okay. Uh...

743
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,123
Hello, everyone!

744
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,958
It's so nice to meet you.

745
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,835
I'm Ju-ye, and I'm 18.

746
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,546
I like eating,
and I really don't like bugs.

747
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,047
Uh, thank you so much!

748
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,841
Let's give her a hand.

749
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:00,468
It's so nice to have you. And you, Su-na?

750
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,556
Su-na?

751
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,809
No need to be nervous.

752
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:08,894
You can just say hi.

753
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,901
Hi, I'm... Han Su-na.

754
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,153
I like drawing, um,

755
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,196
and I don't like...

756
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,240
living with others.

757
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,912
Alright! Welcome!

758
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:30,332
There. You can sit over there
at those empty desks.

759
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,708
- Okay.
- There you go.

760
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,753
Hello!

761
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:41,218
Alright. Today, we'll learn why
we need to change our metabolism.

762
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,053
Open your books, everyone.

763
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,682
Let's first talk about
the anatomy of humans as things stand.

764
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:51,686
Because we currently need to drink water
and consume food

765
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,104
in order to survive,

766
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:57,817
we've wasted precious resources on people
that do not serve the greater cause.

767
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,279
To be frank, we are weak,

768
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,366
and in our current world,
which is plagued by a shortage of water,

769
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:08,787
mankind needs to take
a new, stronger physical form.

770
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,290
We must develop a new metabolic system

771
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:15,001
in order to breed humans that can survive

772
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,880
for extended periods
of dehydration and malnutrition,

773
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,883
thereby reversing the population decline

774
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:26,388
and paving the way
for civilization to be reborn.

775
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,347
Children,

776
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,225
in this harsh and unforgiving world,

777
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:34,271
always remind yourselves
of Dr. Yang Gi-su's miracle

778
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:37,107
and of your own responsibilities.

779
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,403
Our metabolism will improve through
Dr. Yang's research, and eventually,

780
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,531
mankind will finally be given a body

781
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,825
which can adapt to this brave new world.

782
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,743
Pay attention, Su-na.

783
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,165
It's just odd.

784
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,710
Nobody even has enough to drink
on the outside,

785
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,879
yet the people here are able to drink
however much they want and even shower.

786
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,716
Everyone keeps going on and on
about Dr. Yang Gi-su.

787
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:07,304
Shouldn't he be giving water
to everybody out there who needs it?

788
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,602
Oh, Su-na.

789
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,314
The outside world is full of barbarians.

790
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:21,526
The exact same type that killed
Yang Gi-su's beloved daughter.

791
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,572
In order to join the new humanity,

792
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,534
you need to be the right kind of person.

793
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,119
What kind...

794
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,954
what kind of person is that?

795
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,000
People that offer aid
in furthering the doctor's research.

796
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,711
I wanna be a part of the research support.

797
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:45,842
Well, you sound like
you have the right attitude, Ju-ye, no?

798
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,678
Su-na sure could learn a lot from you.

799
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,888
Yes, ma'am.

800
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,223
Now, then, for our next lesson,

801
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:56,728
we'll be learning about organisms
that are best at surviving in the wild.

802
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,397
We'll be getting a visit
from Dr. Yang Gi-su later,

803
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,693
so let's all welcome him properly

804
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,986
to show our gratitude.

805
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,321
Yes.

806
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,498
These rations are
the fruits of your parents' hard work,

807
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,083
as I'm sure you're all aware.

808
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,752
Let us all dig in with a thankful heart.

809
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:21,961
And there's the water,

810
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:25,298
which is more valuable
than anything else in this world.

811
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,176
Make sure to drink it all
down to the very last drop.

812
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:31,888
Dr. Yang Gi-su had it specially purified
for all of you here.

813
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,473
Ju-ye.

814
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,351
Hello, everyone.

815
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,687
Alright,
a round of applause, everyone.

816
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,065
Attention.

817
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:42,982
Bow.

818
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,820
"Students are our hope."

819
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,572
I'm sure you're all aware
of our apartment's motto, right?

820
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:53,910
That's the reason we've been supplying
our students with a special diet.

821
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:58,790
The world is beset by a shortage
of food and water, as you know.

822
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:01,418
I'm working day and night
to create a new world

823
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,671
where humans are going to be able
to survive and live a good life

824
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,549
with only a minuscule amount
of food and drinking water.

825
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,384
But until that day comes,

826
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,095
you all need to finish
everything you're given,

827
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,471
making sure not to waste any.

828
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,514
Yes.

829
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,391
Alright.

830
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,184
Doctor, we have someone very promising.

831
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,894
- Oh, there.
- Mm-hmm. She's wonderful.

832
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:20,812
Her name?

833
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,855
Lee Ju-ye.

834
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,107
Lee Ju-ye, right?

835
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,066
Yes.

836
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,777
Hi. You're 18?

837
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,070
Yeah!

838
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,406
I heard you really wanted to help me
with my research.

839
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,407
Mm.

840
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,368
Why don't we get the ball rolling
with a consultation?

841
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,786
- Yes, of course.
- Uh-huh.

842
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,289
Well, uh, why don't we have you eat first?

843
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,875
Uh, I'll send someone over to meet you

844
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,252
in three hours, huh?
And then we can get started.

845
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:46,629
Oh wow! Thank you, Doctor.

846
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,174
- Right.
- Let's go.

847
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,426
Dr. Yang.

848
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:56,097
Where's my grandmother?
Did she get here safe?

849
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,100
Of course she did. Don't you worry.

850
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,312
If my grandmother's here, I wanna see her.

851
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,443
Excuse me.

852
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,654
Did you explain everything to her?

853
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,282
I'm so sorry.

854
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,453
Su-na.

855
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,373
Uh, your grandmother is much worse
than we expected,

856
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,752
so we'll have to keep her in treatment
for the next two to three days.

857
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,129
Grandma got that sick on the way here?

858
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,800
She just needs to rest, okay?

859
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,345
You're going to be able
to see her in a day or so.

860
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,598
Dr. Yang Gi-su himself is
personally seeing to her treatment...

861
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,016
Yes, of course. Now,

862
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:43,269
I have been overseeing her care,
so don't worry, okay?

863
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,480
She's going to be much better soon,

864
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:46,439
and...

865
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,857
Oh, Su-na.

866
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,236
Su-na, you're terribly malnourished
right now. Huh?

867
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,946
So drink some water.

868
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,323
You'll regain your health. Here.

869
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,162
Hmm?

870
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,340
Alright, then. Enjoy your dinners,

871
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,551
and don't forget,

872
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,344
you are our future!

873
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,752
- Alright, clean things up here.
- Yes, sir.

874
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,714
It's been over 20 hours,

875
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,049
and Sergeant Choi
and Sergeant Oh haven't returned.

876
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,927
Things could get bad for them
if they don't make it in time.

877
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,179
They should be okay.

878
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,183
Maybe we should hand out personal doses

879
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,935
in case of situations like this.

880
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,148
It's still too dangerous
for people to carry.

881
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:13,860
Besides, there's no telling what kind
of side effects we'll see going forward.

882
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,446
How long are
we going to have to keep injecting?

883
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,366
We're starting to run out of children
to bring to the apartment.

884
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:23,661
We're gonna get there.

885
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,706
Just be patient.

886
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:30,793
Get back to work.

887
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,422
They only care about themselves.

888
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,049
Dignity for humans?

889
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,175
Long gone.

890
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,641
This research needs to
come to fruition, right?

891
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,685
If we want a meaningful life...

892
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,147
it'll only be when...

893
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:52,815
when they realize

894
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,234
the sacrifices
of these evolutionary rejects

895
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,070
was necessary for survival.

896
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,781
That day will come, don't you think?

897
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,068
Time for a shift change.

898
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,373
Excuse me. Excuse me.

899
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:55,211
Uh, we, uh, signed up
to see our child earlier on.

900
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,796
When will we be able to go see her?

901
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,631
A meeting? What do you mean, meeting?

902
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,050
The teacher said
that after we finish our work for the day,

903
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,635
we could sign up to visit our daughter.

904
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,761
Uh, there's, um...

905
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:07,306
- We don't have that policy.
- She definitely told us that earlier on.

906
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:10,393
We're happy to go to the eighth floor
if Ju-ye can't come down.

907
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:14,063
The eighth floor is especially off-limits
to regular residents.

908
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,399
Uh, well, where's the teacher, then?

909
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,569
You know what?
Where's our daughter?

910
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:22,363
What the hell do you mean
we can't go see our child?

911
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,281
This is ridiculous!

912
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:24,991
They're stopping them
seeing their child.

913
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,367
I hope our kids are okay.

914
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,619
Don't mind us and change shifts, everyone.

915
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,247
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

916
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,624
- Wait, wait, wait. Where's Ju-ye?
- No, look here.

917
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,794
Huh? Where the hell is our daughter,
you bastards?!

918
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,987
Listen, how many times
do I have to tell you

919
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,947
not to interrupt me
when I'm experimenting?

920
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,492
I'm sorry, sir. Too many witnesses
for me to take care of it.

921
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,952
Jesus, we bent over backwards
to get these kids.

922
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,129
So they're in
the purification facility?

923
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,339
Let's get down there.

924
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,634
Sergeant Kang, please go upstairs
and prepare the drugs and the catheter.

925
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:25,885
Right away, sir.

926
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,406
God, this is so embarrassing.

927
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,122
Let me see my daughter!

928
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:56,749
Why would you lie to us?

929
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,585
The teacher told us
that we would be able to see her tonight!

930
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,045
Right, go check with her.

931
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:02,922
- Calm down.
- Check with her.

932
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,465
Where's the teacher?

933
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,175
Why do you keep lying to us?

934
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,635
Hey, what's going on?

935
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,303
Huh? What's this about? Guys...

936
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,848
Please, Doctor, please tell us.
Where is Ju-ye?

937
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,099
You guys,

938
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,726
you said we could meet her.
You can't just go back on your word!

939
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,270
Calm down, please!

940
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,771
Ju-ye is doing great.

941
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:22,400
- She's all settled in now.
- Doctor, please let us see our daughter.

942
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:24,151
- Now, wait, wait, don't...
- I'm begging you!

943
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:27,446
There's no need to cry.
Please, please settle down.

944
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,491
Okay, fine.

945
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:34,328
Let's go to the lab to see her.
Come with me. Let's go see Ju-ye.

946
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,832
Let's go. Yeah.

947
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:40,877
Okay, thank you. Let's go.

948
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,333
{\an8}REPTILIAN REGENERATION EXPERIMENT

952
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,658
Ju-ye...

953
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,202
Ju-ye.

954
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,501
This way.

955
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:07,588
So... so she's in here?

956
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,841
Why would, uh...

957
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,511
There, see that? She's fine.

958
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:16,097
- Ju-ye!
- Ju-ye... Ju-ye!

959
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,432
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
don't stimulate her in any way!

960
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,726
Or else you'll put her life at risk.

961
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,895
You can see
that she's a very valuable asset here

962
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,855
and giving herself for us all.

963
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,233
Doctor, can you explain what this is?

964
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,318
Is Ju-ye sick or something?

965
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,778
No, she's completely healthy.

966
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:33,030
It's just that kids her age
have something right here.

967
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,324
"The children are our future."

968
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,701
That's our whole motto, isn't it?

969
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,248
Now, now, now, here, look.
This is my daughter.

970
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,625
Everyone said that she was dead,
but I brought her back.

971
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:47,628
I've basically created
an undying breed of humanity.

972
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:57,888
What?

973
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,393
Humanity has a chance at being preserved,

974
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:04,103
thanks to you and your daughter.

975
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:07,398
Now do you understand what a vital role
she plays in this research?

976
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,233
Ju-ye.

977
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,737
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I said not to stimulate your daughter!

978
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,656
Jesus! I told you not to touch her! Shit!

979
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,118
What's wrong with her?

980
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,786
What's going on with our daughter?

981
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,997
- What's happening?
- Ju-ye!

982
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,874
I told you not to touch her!

983
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,544
Oh my God, do something!

984
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,880
Do something!

985
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:34,633
What's wrong with her?

986
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,720
What's happening to her?

987
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:50,649
- Ju-ye.
- Oh my God, Ju-ye... Is she dead?

988
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,526
Wake up, Ju-ye.

989
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,361
I was away for too long.

990
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,323
I told you what would happen. Now look!

991
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,158
- Ju-ye...
- Ju-ye?

992
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,493
Ju-ye!

993
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,912
- See this? Huh?
- Ju-ye...

994
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,126
You have no idea

995
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,837
how important this research is, do you?

996
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:17,218
I gave you food, clean water,

997
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:18,177
shelter...

998
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,471
Why don't you trust me?!

999
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,842
Clean-up crew. Clean-up crew to the lab.

1000
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,019
Su-na,

1001
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:10,729
why are you up here?

1002
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,109
What a coincidence, huh?

1003
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,160
I really appreciate
you having my back on this.

1004
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,539
There's no way in hell
I could do this alone, you know?

1005
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:30,958
I'm just here for Su-na.

1006
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,669
And also 'cause

1007
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:36,505
he'll shut his trap
when Su-na's around again.

1008
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,885
I'm not a good person.

1009
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,972
There's a lot of blood on my hands.

1010
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,977
It's morning now.

1011
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,146
Rise and shine.

1012
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,815
We're leaving already?

1013
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:15,002
Sure must be nice, being so young.
Very minimal side effects,

1014
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,922
and the drugs work great on you.

1015
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,049
I know why you're keeping
all these children.

1016
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,886
You're using us like lab rats
so you can survive.

1017
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:26,222
Oh, no, don't worry.

1018
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,474
You're better than a lab rat.

1019
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,352
No, we're depending on you to survive.

1020
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:34,355
What happened to Ju-ye earlier
was very unfortunate.

1021
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:36,732
Why are you
experimenting on children's necks?

1022
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:41,237
The teenage pituitary gland generates
material that allows the process to occur.

1023
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,865
Now, it does need a bit of fine-tuning.
Doesn't work right away.

1024
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:47,952
In the classroom,
when you were drinking the water?

1025
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:48,994
That activates it.

1026
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,246
It's amazing, right?

1027
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:53,165
That we're able to achieve that
with just a little water?

1028
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,418
Where's Grandma, then?

1029
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:01,340
Did you seriously believe
she's in treatment?

1030
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:05,594
The weak among us need to be thinned out

1031
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:08,305
so we can make way for the new breed.

1032
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:10,683
Whoa, stay still.

1033
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,237
- Hey, don't screw this up, okay?
- Trust me, alright?

1034
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:30,077
Hey, how you doing?

1035
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,203
What happened to you?

1036
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,580
Oh, I just got into a scuffle

1037
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:36,667
with some crazy gorilla motherfucker
a couple days ago.

1038
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,210
What brings you here today?

1039
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,005
I'm here to make a delivery, bro.

1040
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,424
You're only supposed to come
on certain days, you know?

1041
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:45,426
Oh shit.

1042
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:48,304
Well, you know, I was just passing by,

1043
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:51,807
so I figured I'd make a delivery
and come see my buddy while I'm at it.

1044
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,476
Hey, what's with that?

1045
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,353
- Look in the back.
- Yes, sir.

1046
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,106
Shut it off.

1047
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:14,830
What's going on?

1048
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:17,958
Whoa!

1049
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,377
Whoa, whoa!

1050
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,301
Hold on to something!

1051
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,933
Ah, slow down, slow down!

1052
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:39,980
Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1053
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:49,031
Hey, you son of a bitch!

1054
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:17,893
You crazy bastard!
You're insane!

1055
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:26,193
Ji-wan!

1056
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,202
It's those people.
We saw them when we picked up Su-na.

1057
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:36,829
We have to go warn the doctor.

1058
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,664
Okay.

1059
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:41,708
Sergeant Lee's going to
the prison underground.

1060
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:43,210
Don't follow her down there.

1061
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,254
I left a gift for her.

1062
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:56,807
Hurry, let's move in!

1063
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:04,273
- Please don't kill me! I'm sorry!
- Oh shit.

1064
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,612
You don't have to shoot me.

1065
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:12,823
This way.

1066
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:18,287
Oh! Oh! Shit, man! Oh God! Ah!

1067
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:21,415
Try to relax, Su-na.

1068
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:26,962
What is it now?

1069
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:27,921
Dr. Yang.

1070
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:30,757
I'm sorry, sir, but it's important.

1071
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:33,177
Sergeant Lee's returned,
and there's others.

1072
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,720
From the village where we got Su-na.

1073
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,389
I'm sure Master Sergeant Kwon
has it under control.

1074
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,482
Looks like your friends came to see you.

1075
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,611
Shame they won't get a chance to.

1076
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,005
You sure it's in there?

1077
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:10,964
Yeah, I'm sure.

1078
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,555
How come no one's following us?

1079
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,795
You guys, it's Sergeant Lee. Are you okay?

1080
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:54,758
Hyung!

1081
01:16:04,017 --> 01:16:06,228
Your subordinates
don't seem too fond of us, huh?

1082
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,773
Hey, snap out of it.

1083
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,942
They're not human anymore.

1084
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:53,400
Get it together!

1085
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:55,629
Hey, you guys all good?

1086
01:17:58,256 --> 01:18:00,217
Man, what the hell are these monsters?

1087
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:03,512
This was a mistake. We're doomed now.

1088
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:05,931
I'm sorry.

1089
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,185
<i>Ah, ah, attention all residents.</i>

1090
01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:12,896
<i>As we all know, there are some intruders</i>

1091
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:16,066
in the apartment
that are threatening everybody's safety.

1092
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,360
Stay in your homes until further notice.

1093
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:21,029
<i>Do not, under any circumstances,
go outside.</i>

1094
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:25,409
<i>We've implemented strict security measures
on the classrooms and student dorms,</i>

1095
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:26,993
<i>so stay exactly where you are.</i>

1096
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,328
Now, one more thing.

1097
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:32,749
I wanna share a quick message with
our trespasser friends in the basement.

1098
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,418
<i>Sergeant Lee Eun-ho,</i>

1099
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:36,169
<i>and, uh, you, the hunter person,</i>

1100
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:38,755
<i>you won't be able to accomplish
what you want here,</i>

1101
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:41,466
so just give up and turn back
before it's too late.

1102
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,970
And then I'll let you
walk away with your lives.

1103
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,513
Ugh, that piece of shit.

1104
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:47,639
<i>Listen!</i>

1105
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,350
<i>This is me giving you one last chance.</i>

1106
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:53,562
<i>There's an intercom in the basement.
Press the button, and give me an answer.</i>

1107
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,689
<i>"We'd like to walk away with our lives"</i>

1108
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:56,857
<i>is option one,</i>

1109
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:59,860
and "we'd like to die a painful death
in the basement,"

1110
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:01,445
<i>that's option two!</i>

1111
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:02,904
Option one.

1112
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:08,201
And, uh, we're taking Su-na too.

1113
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:14,958
Let's go get our girl.

1114
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:19,713
Are you coming with us?

1115
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,096
Master Sergeant Kwon.

1116
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,724
Do not, under any circumstances,
let them up here.

1117
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:32,184
<i>I understand, sir.</i>

1118
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,604
Team A, take the stairwell,
and team B, the basement.

1119
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:38,732
I'll take the center.
We can't let them get up here.

1120
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:40,901
It's in your best interest

1121
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,446
that your friends don't kill
our momentum here.

1122
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:46,698
If you end up dying, too,

1123
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,992
we won't have anyone left
to take your place.

1124
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:51,369
So, please,

1125
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,621
just hang in there.

1126
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:02,756
- What do we do now?
- We're almost out of bullets.

1127
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,656
Grab their weapons.

1128
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:39,376
Get out of here now!
Go find Su-na. I can handle this.

1129
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:41,127
- Are you sure?
- I've got it.

1130
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,337
Be careful.

1131
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:00,647
Oh shit.

1132
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,900
Oh, where is it? Oh shit.

1133
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:05,110
Hey, hey, Ji-wan!

1134
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:06,111
Ugh!

1135
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:06,838
What's going on out there?

1136
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:34,324
We have to go.

1137
01:22:35,867 --> 01:22:36,826
Hey, stay focused!

1138
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,918
- Keep going.
- What about you though?

1139
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:46,670
- Get out of here!
- Ah shit.

1140
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,948
Lee Eun-ho.

1141
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:21,204
Please don't kill us.
We're just workers. Please don't hurt us.

1142
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:24,708
Relax.

1143
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:27,419
I'm looking for a kid named Su-na.

1144
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:29,963
Where are the rest of the kids?

1145
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:33,675
The children are up on the eighth floor.

1146
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:47,897
You guys should go up
to look for your children as well.

1147
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,111
<i>Lee Eun-ho.</i>

1148
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:56,031
Still so worried about others

1149
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:58,408
that you can't find
a way out for yourself.

1150
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:29,355
Su-na.

1151
01:24:30,523 --> 01:24:32,984
Don't shoot! Oh God!
Why are you doing this?

1152
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:42,619
Ugh, my knees.

1153
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:02,972
Come on, don't be like that.

1154
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:05,016
There's still time for you
to make peace with this.

1155
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:09,145
Join us and help us create a new world.

1156
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:11,439
Well, in the world that I want,

1157
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:15,026
there's no room for monsters like you.

1158
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,290
Lee Eun-ho,

1159
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:31,084
you wanna keep going till the end?

1160
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:37,901
Oh God!

1161
01:26:50,496 --> 01:26:51,748
Where is Han Su-na?

1162
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:55,376
Where is she?!

1163
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:00,215
She's with the doctor.

1164
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:04,469
Lead the way.

1165
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:09,933
You should get out of here.

1166
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:12,185
Don't you want to see your parents?

1167
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:20,026
Come on, let's go.

1168
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:20,944
Hey.

1169
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:28,326
Don't come closer, or else I'll shoot her.

1170
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:29,827
Be my guest.

1171
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:32,497
That woman just... disappoints.

1172
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,458
Master Sergeant Kwon,
have you gone completely crazy?

1173
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:37,460
Hey, soldier boy.

1174
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:40,421
Why aren't the elevators working
in here?

1175
01:27:42,006 --> 01:27:43,800
I'll take care of him. You go find Su-na.

1176
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:54,310
What happened to you?

1177
01:27:56,312 --> 01:27:57,730
Something's on your face.

1178
01:27:58,690 --> 01:27:59,941
So you're the hunter, then?

1179
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:01,651
Guess you're my catch of the day.

1180
01:28:02,902 --> 01:28:03,820
Amusing.

1181
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,155
I've been looking for you.

1182
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:08,783
Look, I don't have time. Let's do it.

1183
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:53,244
I finally did it.

1184
01:28:58,374 --> 01:29:00,376
You weren't waiting too long, right?

1185
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:16,434
At last!

1186
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:19,354
You're a monster, you know that?

1187
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:26,194
Do you really think

1188
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:31,074
that there is any point
in saving your daughter now?

1189
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:34,744
This is rare, Su-na.

1190
01:29:34,827 --> 01:29:37,080
It usually takes much longer to wake up.

1191
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,417
Nice to be young, I guess.

1192
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:44,420
Grandma always said that

1193
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:47,382
everybody...

1194
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:53,971
...is always bound to reap
whatever seeds they sow.

1195
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:57,225
You will suffer the consequences

1196
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,520
for everything that you've done.

1197
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:06,609
Your daughter

1198
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:10,196
would never approve of

1199
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,281
who you are now.

1200
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:20,123
You want me to just cut off your tongue?

1201
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:48,067
You said the contents needed
a little fine-tuning, right?

1202
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:51,487
That strange water
that you gave all of us,

1203
01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:54,782
I didn't drink a drop of it.

1204
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:56,576
Oh, you... Shit.

1205
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:05,209
It's amazing, right?

1206
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:09,630
That we can achieve that
with just a little water?

1207
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:18,347
Oh God! Doctor!

1208
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:26,314
Don't come closer.

1209
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:30,526
Drop the gun.

1210
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:33,112
Drop the gun!

1211
01:31:36,115 --> 01:31:37,033
God damn it.

1212
01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:48,794
You crazy bastard!

1213
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:57,220
- So-yeon. Get So-yeon first.
- What?

1214
01:31:57,887 --> 01:31:59,889
I said to go pack So-yeon up first!

1215
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:00,973
Oh, yes.

1216
01:33:24,348 --> 01:33:26,642
Ugh, why won't you bastards
just die already?

1217
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:27,852
You can't kill us.

1218
01:33:28,519 --> 01:33:29,395
You sure?

1219
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:41,240
Ugh!

1220
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:43,909
Ah shit, that's an ugly mug.

1221
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:51,334
Kim Hak-yong!

1222
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:57,089
Are you alright? What happened?

1223
01:33:57,173 --> 01:33:58,966
Huh? What happened to you? Huh?

1224
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,344
Ji-wan!

1225
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:03,721
Alright, let's go.

1226
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:05,640
Ah, come on, come on!

1227
01:34:15,941 --> 01:34:17,360
Oh God, Doctor...

1228
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:18,444
Wait!

1229
01:34:18,527 --> 01:34:21,197
Doctor, save me. Save me, Doctor.

1230
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,490
You,

1231
01:34:22,573 --> 01:34:24,075
you said you would save me.

1232
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:27,495
The shot. Oh God, where's the shot?

1233
01:34:27,578 --> 01:34:29,205
You're gonna die even if you take it.

1234
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:31,415
No, no...

1235
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:34,460
No, don't do it! Don't do it!

1236
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,550
You son of a bitch!

1237
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,643
What the...? What just happened up there?

1238
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:52,687
What is happening?

1239
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:10,329
It's okay, sweetheart. Huh?

1240
01:35:10,413 --> 01:35:13,124
We can just start over.
You believe in your dad, right?

1241
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:18,629
Hey, Ji-wan!

1242
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,389
Hey, Ji-wan!

1243
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:30,558
Hey. Hey.

1244
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:32,017
Hey, wake up. Hey.

1245
01:35:32,601 --> 01:35:33,436
Su-na.

1246
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:34,854
Su-na.

1247
01:35:34,937 --> 01:35:36,439
Su-na, you alright?

1248
01:35:36,522 --> 01:35:37,523
Su-na, are you okay?

1249
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:40,067
You're here...

1250
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:41,193
Alright.

1251
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:42,403
Let's get out of here.

1252
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:52,830
What are they doing? I made an order
for everybody to stay in their rooms.

1253
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:54,582
Everybody!

1254
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:57,501
- It's Dr. Yang!
- Stay away from our children!

1255
01:35:57,585 --> 01:36:00,546
- Our child is in the building!
- What did you do, huh?

1256
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:04,133
You're asking the wrong person.
Get out of the way!

1257
01:36:04,216 --> 01:36:05,134
No, no, no!

1258
01:36:05,634 --> 01:36:08,763
We've done everything you told us.
What have you been doing to our kids?

1259
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,306
Let go!

1260
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:11,766
You people,

1261
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:15,144
you were all living in luxury,
pawning off your kids, huh?

1262
01:36:15,227 --> 01:36:17,438
Isn't it a little late
to start pretending that you care?

1263
01:36:17,521 --> 01:36:20,608
No, you can't get away with it!
You won't get away!

1264
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:25,863
Get him away from that! Grab that!

1265
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:29,200
So-yeon! So-yeon!

1266
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:34,747
- Is everyone alright?
- Yeah.

1267
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:35,664
Let's get Yang Gi-su.

1268
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:38,542
We might lose him if we go together.
You take the kids and move down.

1269
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,044
Understood.

1270
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:42,421
Let's go.

1271
01:36:44,006 --> 01:36:45,132
Be careful, Nam San.

1272
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,051
Hurry.

1273
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:54,058
What the fuck is in the bag?

1274
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:57,019
You will pay for this!
You're gonna rot!

1275
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:01,398
Wait!

1276
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:06,946
What? He... he's a monster! A monster!

1277
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:16,038
You...

1278
01:37:16,121 --> 01:37:18,040
you pieces of shit, you...

1279
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:20,292
Oh my God.

1280
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,797
Die!

1281
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:33,430
All of you, just die already! Die!

1282
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:40,688
You all deserve to die, all of you.

1283
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:44,567
I should kill every one of you.
Good-for-nothing, evolutionary rejects!

1284
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:46,777
Your death is coming!

1285
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:58,330
No, no.

1286
01:37:58,414 --> 01:37:59,498
No...

1287
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:06,005
So-yeon.

1288
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:09,174
So-yeon, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1289
01:38:09,258 --> 01:38:11,343
I'm... I'll bring you back, So-yeon.

1290
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:14,513
It's okay. It's okay.

1291
01:38:15,472 --> 01:38:17,057
Oh, I'm so sorry!

1292
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:23,314
My little girl.

1293
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:04,521
Yang Gi-su!

1294
01:39:15,157 --> 01:39:16,492
Don't come any closer!

1295
01:39:17,868 --> 01:39:18,786
Stay right there!

1296
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:20,996
I have to save my daughter.

1297
01:39:22,581 --> 01:39:23,874
Stay where you are!

1298
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:28,003
Yeah!

1299
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:30,798
That's enough, you monster!

1300
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,302
Look at what you did!

1301
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:37,346
You couldn't save anybody,

1302
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:39,390
not even your little girl.

1303
01:39:59,743 --> 01:40:01,245
You've ruined everything.

1304
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:05,499
You've ruined the whole plan.

1305
01:40:15,217 --> 01:40:16,677
I was right all along.

1306
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:19,847
And you've ruined everything.

1307
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:21,640
You ruined...

1308
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:24,727
you ruined...

1309
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:45,581
Come on. Let's go.

1310
01:41:11,607 --> 01:41:12,691
What are you gonna do now?

1311
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:14,610
I think I'll stay here
and start over again.

1312
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:23,827
It's raining!

1313
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:25,412
It's raining!

1314
01:41:39,176 --> 01:41:42,805
- Oh my goodness!
- Let's go home now. I'm ready.

1315
01:41:43,388 --> 01:41:45,015
Right, let's go.

1316
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:47,768
God, that's refreshing!

1317
01:42:14,336 --> 01:42:17,589
I'm so happy to be back, Mom! Dad!

1318
01:42:17,673 --> 01:42:20,717
- Line up properly, people!
- Got anything good for us?

1319
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,511
Everybody, step forward.

1320
01:42:22,594 --> 01:42:23,804
Su-na!

1321
01:42:28,308 --> 01:42:29,268
Su-na,

1322
01:42:29,351 --> 01:42:32,312
white pigs like these
are chock-full of flavor.

1323
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:33,522
- Mmm...
- Hmm?

1324
01:42:33,605 --> 01:42:35,816
Oh? Um, whoa...

1325
01:42:42,656 --> 01:42:44,491
Good luck with that, huh?

1326
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:47,202
- What do you mean by that? What?
- Hey, Ma! Over here!

1327
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:48,704
"Ma"? What're you doing?

1328
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:52,624
Uh, thanks, but I'm sober.

1329
01:42:54,877 --> 01:42:56,503
What's with that ribbon she's wearing?

1330
01:42:57,713 --> 01:42:58,672
Let me through.

1331
01:42:58,755 --> 01:42:59,840
- Whoa!
- Where are you going?

1332
01:42:59,923 --> 01:43:01,758
<i>I've suffered enough.
Leave me alone.</i>

1333
