00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:52,084
A quieter one?

312
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:53,918
[Molly] Wow! Look at this!

313
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,751
Molly! Get away from that.

314
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,376
- Ginge, can we talk about the whole...
- [Fowler] She's right, you know.

315
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:00,668
[tense music plays]

316
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:04,709
- [yelps]
- Careless squawks cost lives.

317
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:06,501
We have to lie low.

318
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:09,793
I'm running a camouflage lesson at noon.

319
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,751
<i>If</i> you can find me.

320
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:15,834
- [Fowler yelps]
- [hens] Ooh.

321
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,626
[Molly] What's it for, Mum?

322
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:23,626
[chickens clucking inside truck]

323
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:26,209
[gasps] Oh! What is that?

324
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:27,959
[chickens clucking loudly]

325
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:31,543
It's got a chicken sitting
in a bucket on it.

326
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:33,376
It's doing this.

327
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:35,418
[giggles] Oh, that's so funny.

328
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:37,834
Uh, let's go home.

329
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:39,709
[Molly sighs]

330
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,501
[chuckles softly]

331
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:45,043
Where are they going?
[gasps] Can we go with them?

332
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:47,376
- It looks like a lot of fun.
- I'm sorry, Molly.

333
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:49,834
- You're not ready to go off the island.
- But I...

334
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:52,501
Uh, Rocky? Little help?

335
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:54,959
Maybe I could crow on weekends. Y'know?

336
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,418
Why am I not ready?

337
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:57,793
I'm a big, brave girl.

338
00:14:57,793 --> 00:15:00,043
- You always say so.
- I know.

339
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:01,751
But you're still a child.

340
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:03,209
Says who?

341
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,418
Says me and your dad.

342
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:06,584
Right, Rocky?

343
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:10,001
Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yes.
Listen to your mom, kiddo.

344
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:14,001
Oh! Oh. How about just half a crow?
Like a "cock-a" or "doodle-doo"?

345
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:15,543
Something that's a little shorter.

346
00:15:15,543 --> 00:15:20,876
Well, I'm going over to see those trucks
because I am a Lone Free Ranger.

347
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,209
Like Dad was.

348
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:23,209
[both gasp]

349
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:24,626
I've seen his poster.

350
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:25,751
Ah.

351
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:28,459
He used to live over there,
and you did too.

352
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:31,293
- [Ginger gasps]
- [laughs nonchalantly, clears throat]

353
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:34,334
Did I say that? I don't... I don't remember.

354
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,418
That's it.

355
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:37,918
Molly, you are not leaving this island.

356
00:15:37,918 --> 00:15:40,876
You can't make me stay here.
You're not the boss of me.

357
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:43,126
Actually, I am.

358
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:48,501
Look, Molly, you've got
everything you want right here.

359
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:50,626
Except for one thing.

360
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:52,001
And what's that?

361
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:55,126
Freedom.

362
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:56,751
[Ginger gasps]

363
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:58,584

[door slams]

365
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:06,501
- [Ginger sighs]
- You know, she <i>is</i> a lot like you.

366
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:09,751
[Ginger gasps, sighs] Mm.

367
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:14,418
- [owl hooting]
- [tense music playing]

368

[Ginger gasps]

373
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:36,668
[Mrs. Tweedy, distorted] Your daughter
is going to be delicious!

374
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:39,543
- [Ginger screams]
- [yelps] Not the face! Not the face!

375
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:42,209
- [groans, grunts]
- [gasps]

376
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,668
- Huh?
- [gasps] Molly?

377
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:47,709
- [gasps]
- [Rocky gasps]

378

- [ominous music playing]
- [hens calling] Molly?

379
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:51,959
- [hen 1] Come out, Molly!
- [hen 2] Molly!

380
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,293
- [hen 3] Molly?
- [Babs] Molly?

381
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:54,668
- [Bunty] Molly!
- [Fetcher] Molly!

382
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:56,376
- [Ginger] Molly?
- Molly!

383
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:58,043
- [Ginger gasps]
- [Fowler] Come out, Molly.

384
00:16:58,043 --> 00:16:59,876
- [Rocky gasps]
- [Ginger cries out]

[ominous music swells]

387
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:07,251
[Ginger] No!

388
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:10,543
- She's left the island.
- [crowd clamoring]

389
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:13,334
- [tense music playing]
- [bird calling in distance]

390
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:17,584
[Molly] This isn't so bad.

391
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,709
Don't know what Mum was worried about.

392
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,251
[chuckles nervously]
I'm big and I'm brave.

393
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,751
Yeah, course I am.

394
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:27,709
[shakily] I'm big... [whimpers]

395
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:29,876
- And...
- [low growl]

396
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,501
[gasps] ...not very brave.

397
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,918
- [creature snarls]
- [screams]

398

[owl hoots in distance]

401
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:47,376
Huh?

402
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,126
[tense strings building]

403
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:51,376
Hmm?

404
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:53,584
[Molly yelps]

405
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,043
[groans weakly]

406
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:57,751
[panting, gasps]

407
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:00,793
What were you doin'?
Have you got a death wish?

408
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:02,126
No.

409
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,876
Wait, what's a death wish?

410
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:12,418
Isn't it a bit late
for you to be out, baby girl?

411
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:14,418
I'm not a baby girl.

412
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:16,793
I'm a... I'm a big, brave girl.

413
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:20,376
And isn't it a bit late
for you to be out too?

414
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:25,251
[chuckles] Okay, I like it.

415
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:27,209
Give as good as you get, eh?

416
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:29,834
Well, I'm Frizzle.

417
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,126
And you are?

418
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:34,334
Molly.

419
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:36,793
[sighs] Although,
it's kind of a goofy name.

420
00:18:36,793 --> 00:18:38,459
So I'm thinking of changing it to...

421
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:39,501
Zip it, kidda.

422
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:42,668
- It's stoppin'. Now's our chance.
- [brakes screech]

423
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:46,834
- Are you comin' or not?
- Coming where?

424
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,959
To the happy chicken truck.

425
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,834
[gasps] You've seen them too?

426
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:52,376
Right.

427
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:53,543
[Molly giggles]

428
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:55,668
Wherever that truck's goin',

429
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:59,001
it's gonna be cooler
than a penguin's toenails.

430
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:02,126
Uh, what's a toenail?

431
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:04,084
What's a penguin?

432
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:08,084
Oh! You have got so much to learn.
Come on.

433
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:11,918
[sighs] Wait for me!

434
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:15,959
I mean, so she found my poster,
and I told her a story.

435
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,334
I don't think that's such a big deal.

436
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:21,584
Oh no. It was perfectly sensible
to encourage our daughter

437
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,418
to be a Lone Free Ranger.

438
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:26,084
You know, if you had it your way,
she'd still be in her shell.

439
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:29,084
Well, better in her shell
than out on the open road.

440
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,709
So, do you live on an island too?

441
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:35,876
Nah. I was stuck on a boring old farm.

442
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:39,251
Then the trucks came,
and they said I was too small to go.

443
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:40,793
But that's not gonna stop me.

444
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:42,668
You get to sit in a bucket.

445
00:19:43,168 --> 00:19:45,376
What chicken doesn't want
their own bucket?

446
00:19:45,376 --> 00:19:47,293
I want a bucket.

447
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:48,751
The thing about us, Mol,

448
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:52,501
is that we wanna go
where we wanna go whenever we want.

449
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:55,918
Yeah. With nobody telling us
what we can and can't do.

450
00:19:57,043 --> 00:19:59,668
Me and you, kidda. All the way.

451
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:00,959
[Molly chuckles]

452
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:03,376
[hens clucking]

453
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:05,959
Holy moly.

454
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:12,126
Hear that? It's like a party in there.

455
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:13,543
[bell rings]

456
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:15,293
[tense music playing]

457
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:16,876
[bell rings]

458
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,918
[yelps] Oh!

459
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:21,709
What is that?

460
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:24,418
You've never seen a human before?

461
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:28,084
We had them back at the farm.

462
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:30,126
[quietly] They're kinda stupid.

463
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:33,751
They fed us and tidied up after us.
They're basically like waitin' staff.

464
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:35,001
Oi!

465
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,293
- Oi, you!
- Huh?

466
00:20:36,793 --> 00:20:38,668
How did you two get out here?

467
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:40,793
- What do you say, Molly?
- [Molly] Uh...

468
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:43,584
Do you want to come
on the adventure of a lifetime or not?

469
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,043

That's not a plan.

Mac's right. We need more details.

We only get one shot at this,
so we need to make sure

631
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:29,876
With a cheeky wee trick to open it.

632
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,168
[scanner whirs, chirps]

633
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:35,418
So, only the small matter
of this electric fence.

634
00:28:35,418 --> 00:28:36,543
All these guards.

635
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:38,793
The camera-driven gun-toting moles.

636
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:41,959
And the laser-guided exploding ducks.

637
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:45,626
Please. You've got to help us.
Rocky's in there.

638
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:47,168
Ah, shame. I quite liked him.

639
00:28:47,168 --> 00:28:48,876
And so is Molly.

640
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,584
Molly? Our little niece? [gasps]

641
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,876
Steady, mate.

642
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:55,959
- Stay strong.
- [breathing shakily]

643
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:59,126
[both sobbing]

644
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:03,543

- [splutters] Just tell us what you need.

645
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:07,501

646
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:09,043
[resolute music playing]

647
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:10,709
We can do this, everyone.

648
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:15,126
Bunty, with your strength, my love,
we can move mountains.

649
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:16,709
Mac, you're the brains.

650
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:21,251
Babs, you're our... wool specialist.

651
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:22,334
Ah.

652
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:23,334
Nick and Fetch,

653
00:29:23,334 --> 00:29:26,543
you're the sneakiest little toerags
this side of the Dales.

654
00:29:26,543 --> 00:29:27,834
Oh. [sniffles]

655
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,959
- You're too kind.
- [chuckles] Flatterer.

656
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:33,501
And, Fowler, with your wisdom
and vigilance...

657
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:35,584
- [music stops]
- Fowler?

658
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:37,293
[snoring]

659
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:43,168
Ooh. [splutters] And then the second wave
of bombers approach the target,

660
00:29:43,168 --> 00:29:45,126
and that's where I come in.

661
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:50,418
Actually, Fowler,
we need to find something special for you.

662
00:29:50,418 --> 00:29:52,834
- [whimsical music playing]
- Ah, right.

663
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,543
How about... getaway man?

664
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,043
Getaway man, eh?

665
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:01,293
Hmm. [clicks tongue] Sounds important.

666
00:30:01,793 --> 00:30:02,959
I like it.

667
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:06,376
Right. Let's gather what we need
and hurry.

668
00:30:06,876 --> 00:30:09,501
Who knows what horrors
Molly is dealing with in there.

669

- It's the most amazin' place ever.
- [Molly sighs]

675
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:25,376
And my mum said that's where <i>we</i> live.

676
00:30:25,376 --> 00:30:26,584
[scoffs] Yeah, right.

677
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:29,418
Are the streets paved
with marshmallows where you live?

678
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:31,834
Can ya bounce on them?

679
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:35,168
- No! They're paved with dirt.
- [upbeat music playing]

Actually, my dad can.

Well, everyone can do that here. [gasps]

Wow.

684
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:49,251
I've heard of this,
but I never knew it actually existed.

685
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:51,209
Cool. What is it?

686
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:53,834
All-you-can-eat buffet.

687

[hens grunt]

696
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:18,001
[Molly] I helped Mac with the harvester,
helped Bunty pick carrots,

697
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:20,459
made yarn with Babs.

698
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,543
But here, it's just play.

And then more play.

00:31:29,168 --> 00:31:30,876
I wonder if they're missing me.

702
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:34,334
It's great, innit?
We're free to do whatever we want.

[Fry gasps] Sir Eat-a-Lot.

958
00:44:25,584 --> 00:44:26,584
Right.

959
00:44:26,584 --> 00:44:28,876
It's showtime.

[suspenseful music playing]

961
00:44:37,334 --> 00:44:40,709
Ah, Sir Eat-a-Lot! Welcome. [chuckles]

962
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:43,459
What an honor
to have a knight of the realm with us.

963
00:44:43,459 --> 00:44:46,293
Actually, Sir Eat-a-Lot
is just the name of the restaurant.

964
00:44:46,293 --> 00:44:48,459
My name is... Oh.

965
00:44:50,168 --> 00:44:52,043
[yelps, chuckles]

Oh.

968
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:03,209
[splutters] Here at Fun Land Farms,

969
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:08,251
we do everything we can
to make our chickens feel right at home.

970
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:14,043
Well, I must say, I've never seen
a farm like this before, Dr. Fry.

971
00:45:14,543 --> 00:45:16,668
Is all this security really necessary?

972
00:45:16,668 --> 00:45:17,793
[Fry] Oh yes.

973
00:45:17,793 --> 00:45:18,709
Molly.

974
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:22,126
You see, behind these doors are secrets

975
00:45:22,126 --> 00:45:25,626
that will change
the world of poultry technology forever.

976
00:45:25,626 --> 00:45:26,751
Come on.

977

983
00:45:47,501 --> 00:45:49,668
This place is a maze.

984
00:45:50,168 --> 00:45:52,043
How am I ever gonna find Molly in here?

985
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:53,501
[footsteps below]

986
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,251
- There she is.
- [Rocky] Huh?

987
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:58,168
Molly?

988
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:02,418
Molly! Molly!

[Molly panting]

990
00:46:06,459 --> 00:46:09,501
[Fry] And, um,
how's the restaurant business?

991
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,209
[Smith] Actually, a little slow.

992
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:12,584
[Ginger gasps]

993
00:46:12,584 --> 00:46:15,501

I think we can help you with that.

Right. I'm gone.

1003
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:43,168
Well, can't we just take the lift?

1004

[bell dings]

1005
00:46:45,709 --> 00:46:48,584
All I can say, Dr. Fry,
is this had better be...

1006
00:46:50,043 --> 00:46:51,418
good.

My, uh, partner
will be joining us shortly.

In the meantime, we've prepared
a little presentation. [chuckles]

Hello, Reginald.

I see you've met
my current husband, Dr. Fry.

1068
00:50:07,543 --> 00:50:11,709
Was I attracted to his large inheritance
and vast acres of land?

1069
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,918
No, it was his mind.

1070
00:50:15,918 --> 00:50:20,709
You probably can't tell
by looking at him, but he's a genius.

You flatter me, darling. [chuckles]

Rocky and the rats are on telly.

1086
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,251
Looks like a real cliffhanger.

Oh, Mollypod.

1098

- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1099
00:51:34,334 --> 00:51:36,043
Promise never to run away again.

1100
00:51:36,043 --> 00:51:38,501
- Did they hurt you?
- I'm fine, but I think they eat...

1101
00:51:38,501 --> 00:51:40,793
- [Mrs. Tweedy] Come on. Get on with it.
- Shh.

1102
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:42,668
[Fry] Right you are, pumpkin.

1103

Behold.

1104
00:51:46,751 --> 00:51:50,251
[dramatically] The remote control.

1105
00:51:50,793 --> 00:51:55,043
- And the other remote controls.
- [Mrs. Tweedy grunts]

1106
00:51:55,043 --> 00:51:56,668
Why three?

1107
00:51:59,793 --> 00:52:01,876
- Nobody knows.
- [Mrs. Tweedy grunts]

1108
00:52:02,543 --> 00:52:04,876
Let's go with...

1109
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:07,584
that one.

1110
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:09,459
- [collars power down]
- [hens] Huh?

1111
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,418
- Why am I playing golf?
- Where am I?

1112
00:52:11,418 --> 00:52:14,584
- What am I doing?
- Molly? Where are you, Molly?

1113
00:52:14,584 --> 00:52:16,376
What's going on?

1114
00:52:16,376 --> 00:52:19,126
[splutters] No, no, no.
Wrong one, my angel.

1115
00:52:19,126 --> 00:52:21,334
- That's the off button. [chuckles]

Revenue. That's what I meant.

1163
00:54:32,668 --> 00:54:36,876
I'll send a truck to collect

But you saw what happens. She'll die.

And if we don't leave here now,
then we will die too.

I don't care. I'm not leaving her here.

1179
00:55:13,834 --> 00:55:15,043

You're pushin' us too hard, cuz.

1434
01:05:29,251 --> 01:05:31,834
[sighs] That girl's stupid.

1435
01:05:32,751 --> 01:05:34,043
You were right.

1436
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:38,751
If we ever get home, I'll just stay there
and never leave. Ever.

1437
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:40,959
Hey, no. Molly.

1438
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:42,834
This is my fault.

1439
01:05:43,334 --> 01:05:49,001
I should not have told you all
of that ridiculous Lone Free Ranger stuff.

1440
01:05:50,501 --> 01:05:52,959
No, this is on me.

1441
01:05:54,126 --> 01:05:55,959
I used to hate being fenced in.

1442
01:05:56,668 --> 01:05:59,126
So why did I expect you
to be any different?

1443
01:06:00,376 --> 01:06:02,918
I guess I was afraid
you were so much like me.

1444
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,376
What's wrong with being like you?

1445
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,043
Nothing.

1446
01:06:13,043 --> 01:06:15,876
- Because your mom is the best.
- [sighs]

1447
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:19,126
And she always has a plan.

1448
01:06:20,793 --> 01:06:22,084
Not this time.

1449
01:06:22,626 --> 01:06:23,793
[tense music playing]

1450
01:06:23,793 --> 01:06:25,626
[sighs] He's here.

1451
01:06:25,626 --> 01:06:27,584
[Fry murmuring nervously]

1452
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:29,751
- Are we ready to fry, Fry?
- [buttons beeping]

1453
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:31,418
Five minutes, pumpkin. [chuckles]

1454
01:06:31,418 --> 01:06:33,584
- Make it four.
- [Fry, shakily] Oh.

1455
01:06:33,584 --> 01:06:35,293
Where is she?

1456
01:06:35,293 --> 01:06:36,626
- [bell dings]
- Hmm?

1457
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:41,126
Them runaway chickens, uh,
have got themselves stuck in a corn silo.

1458
01:06:41,751 --> 01:06:43,751
In the silo, you say?

1459
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:47,209
Excellent. I'll go and greet our guest.

1460
01:06:47,209 --> 01:06:49,459
Production starts in three minutes.

1461
01:06:49,459 --> 01:06:50,918
[splutters] Three? [yelps]

1462
01:06:50,918 --> 01:06:55,084
Looks like you've just run out of cluck,
little chickens.

1463
01:06:56,876 --> 01:07:00,959
- [machine whirring]
- [menacing orchestral music playing]

1464
01:07:02,043 --> 01:07:03,001
[rumbling]

1465
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:04,251
[family] Huh?

1466
01:07:04,251 --> 01:07:05,168
[Rocky] Huh?

1467
01:07:05,834 --> 01:07:06,793
Huh?

1468
01:07:06,793 --> 01:07:08,209
[Babs whines]

1469
01:07:11,251 --> 01:07:13,709
I think there's a grinder
at the bottom of this thing.

1470
01:07:13,709 --> 01:07:16,668
On the plus side, though,
we will all probably drown

1471
01:07:16,668 --> 01:07:18,709
before we're ground into tiny, wee pieces.

1472
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:20,543
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1473
01:07:20,543 --> 01:07:22,376
Popcorn. [chuckles nervously]

1474
01:07:22,376 --> 01:07:25,251
Popcorn, everyone. Look.
Look, popcorn. [laughs]

1475
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:28,293
Rocky, I don't think this is the time to...

1476
01:07:30,668 --> 01:07:32,001
Ah.

1477
01:07:32,001 --> 01:07:33,793
[bright music playing]

1478
01:07:33,793 --> 01:07:36,626
The answer to all life's problems.

1479
01:07:36,626 --> 01:07:37,751
Of course.

1480
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:39,959
Mac, we need heat.

1481
01:07:39,959 --> 01:07:41,668
- Lots of it.
- [Mac] Oh.

1482
01:07:42,418 --> 01:07:43,876
Will this work? [grunts]

1483
01:07:43,876 --> 01:07:45,751
[grunts] Perfect.

1484
01:07:46,584 --> 01:07:48,584
[grunts] Now, does anyone have a match?

1485
01:07:48,584 --> 01:07:51,043
Yeah, you and a raving lunatic.

1486
01:07:51,043 --> 01:07:53,334
- You'll blow us all to bits.
- [Molly gasps]

1487
01:07:56,584 --> 01:07:59,501
Besides, we've used the last one.

1488
01:08:00,918 --> 01:08:02,418
Oh no.

1489
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:06,376
- [gentle chimes]
- [Rocky gasps]

1490
01:08:11,168 --> 01:08:13,418
[gasps] That's my girl.

1491
01:08:13,418 --> 01:08:15,959
[suspenseful music playing]

1492
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:20,084
Um, can I once again raise
my health and safety concerns?

1493
01:08:20,668 --> 01:08:21,501
What is it?

1494
01:08:22,001 --> 01:08:23,501
[Rocky and Babs yelp]

1495
01:08:23,501 --> 01:08:25,668
- [both] Huh?
- [rumbling and popping]

1496
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:30,043
All right.

1497
01:08:33,126 --> 01:08:34,084
Oh!

1498
01:08:34,084 --> 01:08:36,709
[alarm blaring]

1499
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:38,584
Mm. That tastes nice.

1500
01:08:38,584 --> 01:08:40,001
Is there any more?

1501
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:41,751
[all scream]

1502
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,168
[Fowler] But guess what?

1503
01:08:52,168 --> 01:08:55,959
Just as Whizzbang Charlie
thought we were back in Blighty,

1504
01:08:55,959 --> 01:08:58,334
enemy fire at six o'clock.

1505
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:01,834
- [whimsical music playing]
- Ye gods. It's raining popcorn?

1506
01:09:01,834 --> 01:09:03,834
Good old British weather.

1507
01:09:03,834 --> 01:09:05,001
Unpredictable.

1508
01:09:05,001 --> 01:09:06,501
You never know what's coming.

1509
01:09:07,001 --> 01:09:08,376
- [groans]
- [Bunty sighs]

1510
01:09:09,126 --> 01:09:11,043
Outrageous.

1511
01:09:11,959 --> 01:09:13,376
[laughs]

1512
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:14,709
[Babs yelps]

1513
01:09:14,709 --> 01:09:16,918
[group groans]

1514
01:09:16,918 --> 01:09:17,959
[Ginger sighs]

1515
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:19,334
[Rocky exhales]

1516
01:09:19,334 --> 01:09:20,793
- [groans]
- [Molly] Hmm?

1517
01:09:20,793 --> 01:09:22,084
[laughing and cheering]

1518
01:09:22,084 --> 01:09:24,168
- Get in there!
- We made it.

1519
01:09:24,168 --> 01:09:25,918
- Look.
- [Fetcher] Whoo-hoo!

1520
01:09:25,918 --> 01:09:29,793
Fowler's only gone
and set up our escape route.

1521
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:34,418
- [bright music playing]
- Well done, you old sausage.

1522
01:09:34,418 --> 01:09:36,834
Firm handshake will do, thank you.

1523
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:41,751
[laughs] Mission accomplished.
Now let's fly this crazy coop, huh?

1524
01:09:42,251 --> 01:09:43,251
[Babs] Oh yes.

1525
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:45,459
[group chattering excitedly]

1526
01:09:45,459 --> 01:09:46,709
[Fetcher] Oh, look, Nick.

1527
01:09:47,626 --> 01:09:49,376
Have we got snacks for the way home?

1528
01:09:49,376 --> 01:09:51,376
[bright music fades]

1529
01:09:51,376 --> 01:09:52,918
[wind gusting softly]

1530
01:09:52,918 --> 01:09:54,334
[sighs]

1531
01:09:56,751 --> 01:09:58,918
[somber music playing]

1532
01:10:00,334 --> 01:10:01,751
- [brakes screech]
- [gasps]

1533
01:10:03,584 --> 01:10:05,293
[guard] All right. On you go.

1534
01:10:06,293 --> 01:10:07,959
[exhales deeply]

1535
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:10,876
[sighs] Mm.

1536
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:15,293
Ginger, are you coming?

1537
01:10:17,209 --> 01:10:18,418
No, I'm not.

1538
01:10:20,209 --> 01:10:21,334
I'm going back.

1539
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:23,001
[Molly gasps]

1540
01:10:25,209 --> 01:10:26,376
For Frizzle?

1541
01:10:28,043 --> 01:10:31,293
For Frizzle and all the chickens.

1542
01:10:33,793 --> 01:10:35,834
- Yes!
- [laughs, sighs]

1543
01:10:35,834 --> 01:10:38,918
[tender instrumental music playing]

1544
01:10:38,918 --> 01:10:44,418
Just because where we live is cut off
from the world doesn't mean we are too.

1545
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,876
No chicken is an island.

1546
01:10:52,209 --> 01:10:53,334
[Rocky] Hmm.

1547
01:10:53,334 --> 01:10:55,209
We are with you, Ginger.

1548
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,168
Aye, me too.

1549
01:10:57,168 --> 01:10:58,626
Me four.

1550
01:10:58,626 --> 01:10:59,751
The rats are in.

1551
01:11:01,084 --> 01:11:02,876
Right. What's the plan, Mum?

1552
01:11:03,751 --> 01:11:08,584
Oh, well, I didn't think you...

1553
01:11:09,709 --> 01:11:10,626
Rocky.

1554
01:11:11,126 --> 01:11:15,793
Hey, Molly, um,
are you sure you're ready for this?

1555
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:18,168
- I was hatched ready, Dad.
- [sighs]

1556
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:21,709
She is a lot like me.

1557
01:11:22,293 --> 01:11:23,459
[reversing alarm beeping]

1558
01:11:30,584 --> 01:11:31,793
[engine stops]

1559
01:11:32,418 --> 01:11:33,709
- [guard groans]
- Dr. Fry!

1560
01:11:33,709 --> 01:11:35,793
What was that noise up on the roof?

1561
01:11:35,793 --> 01:11:38,084
- [guard grunts, thuds]
- Sounded like an explosion.

1562
01:11:38,084 --> 01:11:41,959
{\an8}[gasps, yelps] Looks like one of the silos
has blown its top.

1563
01:11:41,959 --> 01:11:43,501
{\an8}- [alarm blaring]
- Oh.

1564
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:45,501
Maybe you shouldn't have put
those chickens

1565
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,543
through the grinder, my love.

1566
01:11:47,543 --> 01:11:49,251
Don't be ridiculous.

1567
01:11:49,251 --> 01:11:51,959
[Smith] Melisha,
all ready for the big day?

1568
01:11:51,959 --> 01:11:53,418
[Mrs. Tweedy sighs]

1569
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:56,376
[cheerfully] Oh yes, Reginald.

1570
01:11:56,376 --> 01:11:58,251
Everything is tickety-boo.

1571
01:11:58,251 --> 01:12:01,084
[Smith] Jolly good.
My truck is ready to go.

1572
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:02,918
We've got to move fast.

1573
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:05,209
While Tweedy is busy
with her guest outside,

1574
01:12:05,209 --> 01:12:07,293
<i>we sneak back in.</i>

1575
01:12:07,293 --> 01:12:10,959
<i>Molly, you take Bunty, Babs and Mac
to where all the chickens are.</i>

1576
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:12,126
Come on.

1577
01:12:12,626 --> 01:12:14,418
- This way.
- [Babs] Ah.

1578
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:16,168
[Ginger] <i>Stay out of sight</i>

1579
01:12:16,168 --> 01:12:19,709
<i>and get ready to stop
the chickens going up that staircase.</i>

1580
01:12:20,209 --> 01:12:22,876
<i>Rocky, we've got
to get hold of that button</i>.

1581
01:12:22,876 --> 01:12:25,251
- [remote beeps]
- [Ginger] <i>And disable those collars.</i>

1582
01:12:25,251 --> 01:12:26,293
[hens murmur]

1583
01:12:26,293 --> 01:12:28,168
[Ginger] <i>As soon as the collars are off,</i>

1584
01:12:28,168 --> 01:12:31,126
<i>Molly's team leads the chickens
out of there.</i>

1585
01:12:31,793 --> 01:12:34,251
<i>- We bust our way out.</i>
- [hens clamoring]

1586
01:12:34,834 --> 01:12:36,251
<i>Steal the truck,</i>

1587
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:38,001
then we're home free.

1588
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:40,251
Well, what are we waiting for?

1589
01:12:40,251 --> 01:12:43,418
- All right. Let's do this.
- We're doing it today, are we?

1590
01:12:44,168 --> 01:12:46,334
[Fowler] So where was I? Ah, yes.

1591
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:48,709
