00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,666
<i>World War 2 caused
numerous deaths in Britain,</i>

4
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,333
<i>leading to a scarcity of labor in England</i>

5
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:28,666
<i>for working on their farms
and in factories.</i>

6
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,458
<i>So, they encouraged migration from India.</i>

7
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,000
<i>Youth from Punjab settled in England.</i>

8
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:39,500
<i>Witnessing their advancements,
more people were tempted to move.</i>

9
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:44,333
<i>The Commonwealth Immigration Act of 1962
put a stop to migration.</i>

10
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,041
<i>It was no longer easy to go to England.</i>

11
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,875
<i>But the dream
to settle in England persisted.</i>

12
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,125
Hey!

13
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:56,833
You can't smoke.

14
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:00,750
Lighter?

15
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,000
You can't smoke here.

16
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,291
Smoke detector.

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,958
Then take me out.

18
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,958
That's not allowed.

19
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,041
Just keep an eye.

20
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,250
Patel! Where the hell's my visa?

21
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,375
Manu, I'm in a meeting.
It's urgent.

22
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,125
More urgent than this?

23
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,291
Will you guys wait outside?

24
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,250
Manu, come this way.

25
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,125
See, this is the door and...

26
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,125
Enough, Manu!

27
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,916
As an advocate, I can tell you

28
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,375
that your visa for India is difficult.

29
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,833
Pakistan, Singapore, China, Dubai...

30
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,375
name any neighboring country.

31
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,750
- I'll get you a visa in a day.
- Hang on.

32
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:09,583
If your wife's going to Ahmedabad,
do you buy a ticket for Islamabad?

33
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,125
"Best" immigration lawyer? Dimwit!

34
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,333
You are the dimwit!

35
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,875
I'm trying my best. It takes time!

36
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,250
Your case is a mess.

37
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,708
I'm in this mess, thanks to you.

38
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,125
Get out of here!

39
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,666
Go where? It's my office.

40
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,833
Nobody can get you to India!

41
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:32,916
Take it from me.

42
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,458
Your IV bag is empty.
I'll get you a refill.

43
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,166
Drink up!

44
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,291
One man can get me to India.

45
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:53,791
Who?

46
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,583
Hardy.

47
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,541
Hardy who?

48
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,666
Wait, that crazy soldier?!

49
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,125
Are you still in touch with him?

50
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,875
We last met in court.

51
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,500
You were there.

52
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,000
That was 25 years ago!

53
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,583
He could be dead and gone.

54
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,333
God forbid!

55
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,208
If you have a shred of ability,
get me his number.

56
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,208
Welcome to Laltu's Seniors Sports Meet.

57
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:33,666
{\an8}Runners in the 400-meter race are...

58
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:38,083
Mr. Sodhi, gold winner in 2020,

59
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:43,541
Mr. Dhingra, Mr. Gurpal Bhatia,

60
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:47,250
charming Mr. Chawla, dashing Mr. Duggal.

61
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,750
And lastly, Laltu's pride

62
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,625
gold-medal winner of the last two years,

63
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,375
champion Hardy Singh!

64
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,875
Hardy! Hardy!

65
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,583
Hardy! Hardy!

66
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:06,875
Can Hardy pull off a hat trick?

67
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,416
For two years--
Switch off your phone, Geetu!

68
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,083
Sorry. It's Hardy's phone.

69
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,750
{\an8}On your mark...

70
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,166
Hardy! Hardy!

71
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,125
Today-- Switch off the damn phone!

72
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,291
Just a minute. It's a call from London.

73
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,583
Set...

74
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,375
Hardy's in a race. Who's calling?

75
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,083
Hang up, man!

76
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,208
Shut up!

77
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,833
Hardy!

78
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,666
The race is underway!
Mr. Sodhi has seized the lead!

79
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,208
Hold on a moment!
Mr. Hardy has surpassed Mr. Dhingra.

80
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,375
Hardy, it's Manu!

81
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:56,958
<i>What a guy! A jewel!
Runs on love's fuel!</i>

82
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,875
<i>-"What a guy!" women sigh!</i>
- Hardy!

83
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,458
<i>- After creating him...</i>
- It's Manu!

84
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:08,166
<i>The Lord took a bow
I excelled myself somehow!</i>

85
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,208
Sodhi, your pants are falling.
It's a race, not a striptease!

86
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,208
<i>Son of the land
Always takes a stand!</i>

87
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,791
<i>A friend's friend
A foe's woe!</i>

88
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,375
<i>- Ask for his heart and this prince</i>
- Hardy, it's Manu!

89
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,333
<i>- Gives his life without a wince!</i>
- Hardy...

90
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,375
Hardy is about to create a hat trick!

91
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,291
Hardy, call from London.
It's Manu!

92
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,625
Manu!

93
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,416
{\an8}Give me the phone.

94
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:48,958
{\an8}Hello?

95
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,166
<i>Manu?</i>

96
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,833
{\an8}Manu?

97
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,750
Hello, Manu?

98
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:04,958
Where in the world are you?

99
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,000
Right here...

100
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:09,958
in Laltu.

101
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,416
I've been thinking of you.
Aren't you hiccuping?

102
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,541
Sweetie, acidity causes hiccups.

103
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,583
I'm past the delusion
that someone's missing me.

104
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,208
Still angry?

105
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,000
We've got to meet.

106
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,666
Why? Your husband kicked the bucket?

107
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,041
You want the whole saga over the phone?

108
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,625
Can you come to Dubai on the 21st?

109
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,416
Why would I?

110
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,458
I'll tell you when we meet.

111
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,333
I won't come, you crazy lady.

112
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,166
I'm too old for a wild goose chase.

113
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,166
Why? Scared of your wife?

114
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,791
Tell her your old girlfriend
is <i>phoo-phooed.</i>

115
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,583
She needs you.

116
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,166
What <i>phoo-phoo</i> now?

117
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,041
Come to Dubai on the 21st...
I'll tell you in person.

118
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,208
See you soon.

119
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,958
Hello? You there, Manu?

120
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,708
Crazy lady!

121
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:16,416
Patel! Get three visas for Dubai.

122
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,583
{\an8}Three?

123
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,291
{\an8}Who are the other two?

124
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,833
You're discharged?
We were coming to the hospital.

125
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,375
I spent on these flowers.

126
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,208
I bolted from the hospital.

127
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,250
Coming to India? I'm going.

128
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,833
You got the visa?

129
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,333
Yes, for Dubai.

130
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,583
What will we do there?

131
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,958
See India from the Burj Khalifa?

132
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,291
Oxford Circus?

133
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,958
Okay. Hop in.

134
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,916
I leave on the 21st.
If you want to join me, pack up.

135
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,625
Don't whine later that you missed out.

136
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,250
But how do we get from Dubai to India?

137
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,833
Hardy's coming to Dubai.
He'll find a way.

138
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,375
Our Hardy?

139
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,666
Coming to Dubai?

140
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,416
That's wonderful!

141
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,458
Sir, this deal reminds me
of a famous movie dialogue...

142
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,041
"No offense! But you lack business sense."

143
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:29,250
I'd have readily paid 10,000 more
for this shop.

144
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,583
Son, it's you who lacks business sense.

145
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:40,333
If you'd checked
why I was selling this shop,

146
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,416
you could've closed at 25,000 less.

147
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,541
Why are you selling?

148
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,208
Because I'm going back home, son.

149
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:03,833
Twenty-five years...
I've lived in this city.

150
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,000
Here is where I worked,

151
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,208
laughed, cried, made friends.

152
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,500
It's time to say goodbye.

153
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,750
What's going on here?

154
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,291
I'm making a video... memories.

155
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,458
How nice!
But you cannot do this at work time.

156
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,500
No, I have finished my work.

157
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,666
No. Your shift lasts until five.

158
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,041
- Five.
- It's 4:57 p.m., sir.

159
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,958
Exactly! Three more minutes of mopping.

160
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:34,041
Find a dirty spot and mop,
you bloody dishonest immigrants.

161
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:35,791
Come on!

162
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,791
Stop it!

163
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,916
No, sir. Two more minutes left.

164
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,250
Cleaning dirty spot, sir.

165
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,458
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

166
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,625
I'm going home.

167
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:09,083
Laltu... Punjab. India!

168
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,166
Post code 141021!

169
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,958
Lump of dump!

170
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,791
When will Hardy reach Dubai?

171
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,875
He said he wouldn't come.

172
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,958
Stop joking! I sold off my shop.

173
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,250
I gave my boss a bubble bath!

174
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,541
Chill!

175
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,250
I told him I'm <i>phoo-phooed.</i>

176
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:47,833
- Then he'll surely come.
- You bet!

177
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,250
Play a fun Indian movie.

178
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,333
Which one? There are so many.

179
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,041
<i>Life had taken a U-turn.</i>

180
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,250
<i>Today, we were desperate to go to India.</i>

181
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,208
{\an8}<i>Twenty-five years ago,
we were as desperate to get to London.</i>

182
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,125
<i>Each of us had a unique problem.</i>

183
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,750
<i>Manu's problem was her house.</i>

184
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,416
<i>It was seized by the moneylender.</i>

185
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,666
<i>They lived in the annex.</i>

186
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,541
<i>They had to sell their belongings
to make ends meet.</i>

187
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,625
<i>My problem was... my mom's pants.</i>

188
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,916
Take your medicines on time.

189
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,041
<i>Ever since my dad lost his job,</i>

190
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,916
<i>Mom had to wear pants for work
instead of her usual sari.</i>

191
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:48,625
<i>Village oldies turned up daily
to ogle at her.</i>

192
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,958
<i>I had one mission in life.</i>

193
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,625
<i>Make money so my mom could retire.</i>

194
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,875
<i>Balli's problem was the incessant whir
of the sewing machine.</i>

195
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,666
Ma, take a break. Have a cup of tea.

196
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,375
If the machine stops,
so do our meals.

197
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,041
<i>They say money can't buy happiness.</i>

198
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,375
<i>But it can buy potato-parathas!</i>

199
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,791
<i>We took up any odd jobs for a square meal.</i>

200
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,833
Here! The best quality pajamas.

201
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,916
Why show me such large sizes?

202
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,208
Give me a small.

203
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,500
To fit your waist or the little finger?

204
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Out!

205
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,625
Her pajama size is not your problem.

206
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,000
Why didn't you give her what she wanted?!

207
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,750
You told me, "Customer is God."

208
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,375
- Should I lie to God?
- Idiot!

209
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:39,666
Give him a spoon!

210
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,333
<i>Manu made parathas at Bobby's Kitchen.</i>

211
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,708
Take care of the customers.

212
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,250
How much more?

213
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,500
Change their diapers?

214
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,458
<i>Balli was a barber.</i>

215
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,666
Want your hair shortened?

216
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,958
Can you lengthen them? Do it!

217
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,291
Who's this idiot?

218
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,541
I'll take over.

219
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,375
Balli, style Mr. Khosla.

220
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,583
Yes, tell me.

221
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,625
<i>Khosla's locks and our lives
were similar.</i>

222
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,833
<i>Neither could settle down.</i>

223
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,083
<i>Life sucked. The only way out was...</i>

224
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:34,958
<i>England!</i>

225
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,791
<i>In Punjab, those with family abroad</i>

226
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,375
<i>brandished cement airplanes
on their roof.</i>

227
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:48,083
<i>We wanted that life as well.</i>

228
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,708
Hello. Visa for which country?

229
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:01,791
London.

230
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,875
Do you have a degree?

231
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,375
No.

232
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,166
Any property over five acres?

233
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,125
No.

234
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,166
A good bank balance?

235
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,041
No, sir.

236
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,458
Consider it done.

237
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,666
Oh, wow!

238
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,666
Miss Catherine. British citizen.

239
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,958
She's in India.

240
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,875
A penniless junkie.

241
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,916
She'll marry for money

242
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,083
and take you to London.

243
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,250
Once there, part ways.

244
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,625
- I'll marry her.
- I'll marry her.

245
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,208
How can you both marry her?

246
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,541
You marry her.
I'll get you a spouse visa.

247
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,541
For you, I'll get a business visa.

248
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,500
I'll take the spouse visa!

249
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,375
Don't ruin my pal's life with a junkie.

250
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,416
It's decided.
Spouse, me. Business, you.

251
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,958
- Give me the photo.
- Shut up!

252
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:58,916
{\an8}BA, BSc, MSc...

253
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,750
{\an8}Which degree do you want?

254
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,208
Can I get a doctor's degree?

255
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,833
Mom's dream was to see me
in a doctor's coat.

256
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:07,916
{\an8}Consider it done.

257
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:09,833
How will I go?

258
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,750
Stuffed in their suitcases?

259
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,416
No, on a sports visa.

260
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,333
India's women's wrestling team
is going to the Olympics.

261
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,958
The coach is my friend.
You'll go as an extra player.

262
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,416
How much will it cost us?

263
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,250
Five hundred thousand per head.

264
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,041
Sir...

265
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,958
can you reduce it?

266
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,625
To how much?

267
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,500
- Five...
- That's what I said.

268
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,166
Thousand. Five thousand.

269
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,208
Per head!

270
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,750
The grand total will be 15,000!

271
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,625
Go to Nepal instead.
No visa is needed.

272
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,250
Get out!

273
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,291
- Lunch break.
- No problem.

274
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,291
We'll find another agent.

275
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,541
{\an8}- Manu, listen--
- He'll follow us.

276
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,541
- Really?
- But, he isn't...

277
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,541
He will. He's here.

278
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,083
What's your final offer?

279
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,916
- All I have is 5000 rupees.
- Get lost.

280
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,083
- I have 30,000 in the bank.
- Go away!

281
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,000
I have savings of 150,000.

282
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,791
It's my mom's life's earnings.

283
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,583
If you guarantee my visa,
I'll get the money.

284
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,416
Get the money tomorrow and take a receipt.

285
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,375
- Okay?
- Okay.

286
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,458
Madam, find a wrestling coach.

287
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,833
Learn a few moves.

288
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,875
Shouldn't appear you don't know
the basics of wrestling.

289
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,291
Where will I find a coach?

290
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,708
Get in. Hurry.

291
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,958
Bro...

292
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,333
- Damn!
- Climb in quickly.

293
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,625
- Put the bags inside!
- Hey, don't push!

294
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,583
- I didn't do it.
- Right! A storm did.

295
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,583
Put the bags inside.

296
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,416
All my gifts are scattered.

297
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,916
So kill me for that!

298
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,708
- Kill? I...
<i>- Thou art the ruler</i>

299
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,916
<i>Of the minds of all people</i>

300
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,125
<i>Dispenser of India's destiny</i>

301
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:23,000
<i>Thy name rouses the hearts
Of the Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat, and Maratha</i>

302
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,708
<i>Of the Dravida, Orissa, and Bengal</i>

303
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,625
<i>It echoes in the hills
Of the Vindhyas and Himalayas</i>

304
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,250
<i>Mingles in the music
Of the Yamuna and Ganges</i>

305
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,500
<i>- And is chanted by the waves</i>
- Keep this.

306
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,833
<i>Of the Indian Sea</i>

307
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,500
<i>They pray for thy blessings</i>

308
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,000
<i>And sing thy praise</i>

309
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:49,166
<i>The saving of all people waits in thy hand</i>

310
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,250
<i>Thou dispenser of India's destiny</i>

311
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:58,250
<i>Victory, victory, victory!</i>

312
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,791
<i>Victory, victory, victory to thee!</i>

313
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,833
<i>That day a stranger set foot in Laltu.</i>

314
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,750
Sir, please wait.

315
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,750
- It wasn't my fault.
- It's okay.

316
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,458
The last sweet... have it.

317
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,625
<i>He came looking for someone.</i>

318
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,041
{\an8}<i>He had a tape recorder</i>

319
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,833
{\an8}<i>and an address... Bobby's Kitchen.</i>

320
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,291
BOBBY'S KITCHEN

321
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,750
Is there an employee here
with a cheetah tattoo on his arm?

322
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,166
Runs fast!

323
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,416
I'm new. Mr. Bobby will know.

324
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:40,583
Wait for him.

325
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,333
- Greetings. May I sit here?
- Greetings.

326
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,625
Manu, there's a fly in my buttermilk.

327
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,125
A tiny fly!
Won't drink up much.

328
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,791
Spoon out the poor soul.

329
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,541
Kidding! I'll replace it.

330
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,541
- Buttermilk for table seven.
- Greetings.

331
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,791
{\an8}Why are Dumb and Dumber here?

332
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,000
They're here for me.
We have to go at 2:00 p.m.

333
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,416
{\an8}Where?

334
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,041
{\an8}The Wrestling Club.
To get a coach for my visa.

335
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,083
{\an8}Deluded fools!
Who'll let you into London?

336
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,833
I asked you yesterday,
and you nodded, "Yes."

337
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,750
{\an8}Now, I'm nodding, "No."

338
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,583
{\an8}Who'll handle the peak hour?
Your father?

339
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,416
- Don't drag my father into this.
- What if I do?

340
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,666
Shoo them off!
Freeloading buttermilk!

341
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,166
I have paid for it.

342
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,541
So what?

343
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:34,000
Tables are for customers,
not for employees' friends!

344
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,166
Throw them out!

345
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,000
Fine.

346
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,166
I quit.

347
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,875
Now I'm a customer,
and they're my friends.

348
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,833
Hurry, take our order.

349
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,583
Hey, Bobby.

350
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,375
A lemon punch with salt. Pronto!

351
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,833
You'll get a punch, all right.

352
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,333
What's up, buddy?

353
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:08,500
Who the hell are you?

354
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,041
Hardy Singh.

355
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,500
Accept my respects!

356
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,750
- Why attack me?
- Army saying...

357
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,791
Don't waste time in debate,
punch and seal his fate.

358
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,750
The stick was to scare, not hit.

359
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,333
You're lying.

360
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,125
How'd you know?

361
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,541
Because I know scumbags like you.

362
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,750
I can predict their moves.

363
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,208
I'll turn and...

364
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,458
he'll jump on me.

365
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,083
Hello!

366
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,708
My name is Manu Randhawa.

367
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,541
Can you teach me wrestling?

368
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,291
This "my-respects" move.

369
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,416
Please.

370
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,833
I don't live here.
Came to meet someone.

371
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,500
I leave on the night train.

372
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,833
- Sir...
- Mr. Scumbag!

373
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:58,041
I'm looking for a man. He's a runner.

374
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:02,041
Has a cheetah tattoo on his arm.
Any such employee?

375
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,583
Are you looking for Mahinder?

376
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,041
You know him?
Where does he stay?

377
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:07,875
Come with me.

378
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,458
I'm so glad I met you.

379
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,333
How do you know Mahinder?

380
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,541
- I'm his sister.
- Really?

381
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,666
That's so wonderful.

382
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,875
Wow! You have such a big house.

383
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,333
It's not ours anymore.

384
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,750
We lived there once.

385
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,666
Now, we live in the annex.

386
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:39,458
Come in.

387
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,000
Thank you.

388
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,250
That's my mom and dad.

389
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,666
Greetings.

390
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,833
- Greetings.
- My respects!

391
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:46,875
- Bless you.
- Please sit.

392
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,125
I'll take the chair.

393
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,666
I'm Hardy. From Pathankot.

394
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,041
- Pathankot?
- Yes.

395
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,791
A Hardayal Dhillon lives there.

396
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,458
- That's me--
- The wretch!

397
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,500
Terrorists shot him on the highway.

398
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:08,958
My son put him on the shoulder
and ran to the hospital.

399
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:15,458
May I sit, sir?

400
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:18,791
He gave up the Asian Games selections

401
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,583
to rush him to the hospital.

402
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,750
Stayed back to care for him.

403
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:27,875
Played songs from his tape recorder.

404
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,125
Yes.

405
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,125
He left the recorder for the soldier.

406
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,416
Yes, I brought it--

407
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:41,958
It's been a year,
and the soldier never cared to return it!

408
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,750
Ungrateful wretch!

409
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:47,791
This ungrateful wretch
was in the hospital for a year.

410
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,833
I got discharged today
and came straight here.

411
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:52,666
To return your...

412
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:57,833
tape recorder. Here you go.

413
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,166
It's working perfectly.

414
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:02,791
Where's Mahinder?

415
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:05,166
My jaw was broken then.

416
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:06,833
I couldn't speak.

417
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:10,500
I want to give him a big hug
and thank him.

418
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,083
Where is he?

419
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,166
Tea.

420
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,416
It's good.

421
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,083
Then I'll surely have some.

422
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:27,708
This is Mahinder's son.

423
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:29,958
That's his widow.

424
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:40,500
While returning from Pathankot,
my brother had an accident.

425
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,916
He had no shoulder
to carry him to a hospital.

426
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,166
{\an8}BILLA HOUSE

427
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,541
{\an8}This house was ours, not Billa's.

428
00:26:56,541 --> 00:27:00,000
Father's shop was burned
in the 1984 riots.

429
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:03,666
He took a loan from Billa to restart.

430
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,375
{\an8}Then my brother's accident...

431
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:13,375
When we were at the funeral,
Billa seized our home.

432
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:17,625
He said, "Pay up the loan,
get your house!"

433
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,416
{\an8}RANDHAWA HOUSE

434
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,166
{\an8}When he removed
the "Randhawa House" nameplate,

435
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,208
my father cried like a child.

436
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,416
He said, "If my son were alive,

437
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:31,666
we wouldn't be in this situation."

438
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:34,708
I said,

439
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:39,083
"Your daughter is still alive.

440
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,791
I'll earn and repay the loan.

441
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:48,791
{\an8}I vow to tear down Billa's nameplate."

442
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:56,333
That's why I must go to London
to make enough money,

443
00:27:56,833 --> 00:28:01,375
{\an8}get the house back,
and put our nameplate up.

444
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,625
{\an8}That's it.

445
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,375
When do we start training?

446
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,541
Don't you have a train tonight?

447
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,000
I'll fool the Railways.

448
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,375
I have a ticket...

449
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,125
but I won't travel.

450
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:21,041
To save my life,
your brother missed the Asian Games.

451
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:23,666
I can surely miss a train.

452
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:27,708
Only after you board
the plane to London...

453
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,583
I'll take the train to Pathankot.

454
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,291
What do you say?

455
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,791
- Ready for the classes?
- Ready!

456
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:42,458
Down!

457
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,625
Thump your legs and shoulders.

458
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,000
Slap the face.

459
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,541
Not mine.

460
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,875
It's okay.

461
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,208
Push at the neck.

462
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,833
Come here. Once again.

463
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:58,666
Skip all this, Coach.
Teach me that "my-respects" move.

464
00:28:58,875 --> 00:28:59,833
Fine.

465
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,041
Give me your hand.

466
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,291
Hold the wrist.

467
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,041
Grab the arm. Position the leg.

468
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:07,458
- Flip you?
- Yes.

469
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:08,750
- Sure?
- Yes.

470
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:09,916
- Ready?
- Yes.

471
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,958
- My butt!
- Don't laugh. She's learning.

472
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,958
Don't worry.
Manu, give me your hand.

473
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
You okay?

474
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,291
Now you try it.

475
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,625
Hold my hand.

476
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,833
Manu! Not a handshake.

477
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:32,083
<i>Manu Randhawa found her coach.</i>

478
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,666
The visa is yours.

479
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,291
<i>In a week, she aced
the "my-respects" move.</i>

480
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:47,625
<i>Balli set out to wed Catherine.</i>

481
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:51,083
- Is Catherine here?
- She'll be here soon.

482
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:56,833
<i>And I went to get a visa
as a doctor.</i>

483
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:02,875
So, doctor...

484
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:04,875
You're a kidney specialist?

485
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,000
Yo, yo!

486
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:09,958
Tell me... where are the kidneys
in the body?

487
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,500
I... I tell...

488
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,000
Here...

489
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,291
not possible.

490
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,750
Kidney in the heart? No way!

491
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:32,958
This...

492
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,333
as all know, is the belly button.

493
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,833
That leaves only one place.

494
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,250
Shall I?

495
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,208
Here's the kidney!

496
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:51,875
Doctor, your kidneys are at the back.

497
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,291
That's exactly where my hand is!

498
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,000
You're looking at the wrong hand!
You're confused.

499
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:00,125
Focus on this hand.

500
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:15,583
How did you get my wife's photo?

501
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,250
It's my wife... Jessica.

502
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:20,916
- Catherine.
- Jessica.

503
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,500
It's Catherine.

504
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,166
This is Jessica Sandhu.

505
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,916
- No! Catherine Kakkad.
- Hey, what are you doing?

506
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,083
PLEASE MAINTAIN SILENCE

507
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,875
Why fight on your wedding day?

508
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,541
He says, my wife is his.

509
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:34,083
- What?!
- My Catherine.

510
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:36,291
That's my Diana!

511
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,333
My Maria.

512
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:38,291
My Lisa.

513
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,250
My Cynthia.

514
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,625
<i>Phoo-phoo!</i>

515
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,500
<i>Phoo-phoo!</i>

516
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,958
<i>Phoo-phooed</i> badly!

517
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,791
Wrestling learned!
Get my visa...

518
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,458
Manu, we've been <i>phoo-phooed!</i>

519
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,166
Catherine!

520
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:11,875
Return my money, Manu.

521
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:15,125
Why should I return it?

522
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,291
You found the agent.

523
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:20,583
I found him. I didn't birth him.

524
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,791
My mother slogged at the factory
to save up.

525
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,875
She's going to strangle me.

526
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,958
She has to wear pants to the factory.

527
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:34,500
Obviously! She won't go naked.

528
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:36,958
My mom... naked?

529
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,333
Stop it. We'll reason with your mom.

530
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:45,791
I'll come with you.

531
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,333
Mom won't forgive me.

532
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:51,250
Let me try... if I fail,
I'll keep the noose ready.

533
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,000
Listen to my plan first.

534
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,000
<i>Hardy's plan was... Dame Mumtaz!</i>

535
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,833
{\an8}<i>We'd never heard of her. He said...</i>

536
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:08,583
{\an8}<i>"When in a big phoo-phoo,
get Mumtaz for the rescue!"</i>

537
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:12,375
{\an8}Stop! Mom will hang me!

538
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,875
{\an8}No, she'll hug you.

539
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:17,083
Mumtaz will handle her.

540
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,750
Hand me that.

541
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,166
Long live India!

542
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,708
- I have bad news.
- Bad news?

543
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:29,250
When Buggu left the mosque today,

544
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,250
he was <i>phoo-phooed!</i>

545
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:35,375
You're mistaken.
Must be someone else.

546
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,041
Why'd a Sikh boy go to a mosque?

547
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:40,625
To marry Mumtaz. Must've told you...

548
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:43,083
- Mumtaz?
- Yes.

549
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:45,541
- He never told me.
- He must have only invited his friends.

550
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,166
Wait, hold on a second.

551
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,291
Who's Mumtaz?

552
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:53,708
A customer. Buggu fell for her.

553
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:56,083
Happens in a fitting room.

554
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,000
- Her sons got angry.
- Mumtaz's sons?

555
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:03,125
Two sons. A little older than Buggu.

556
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,791
Handsome lads.

557
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:06,500
How old is Mumtaz?

558
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:07,708
Sixty.

559
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:11,166
But a real hottie! Barely looks 50.

560
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,166
- Listen!
- Yes?

561
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:15,000
- Where's Buggu?
- In the hospital.

562
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:18,041
Mumtaz's kids were livid!

563
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,666
Broke Buggu's back.

564
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:24,416
Into three. So medieval!

565
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,583
My Buggu is in a wheelchair!

566
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,791
But please chill...

567
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:34,250
Mumtaz's ex-husband is a janitor
in a hospital in Saudi.

568
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:37,250
He said, "Bring him for treatment."

569
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,666
- Great facilities there.
- True.

570
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:42,208
Shakeel also agreed.

571
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,000
Who's Shakeel now?

572
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,625
Mumtaz's second husband.

573
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,666
He's there as well.

574
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:49,250
My blood pressure is rising.

575
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,708
I'll take care of her.

576
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,291
- I'll give her water.
- Oh, God.

577
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,583
My boy's suffered so much
in a day.

578
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:01,583
Worse still, he didn't get his visa.

579
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:03,125
Damn the visa!

580
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:05,916
You've lost 150,000 rupees.

581
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:10,708
When my son's wrecked,
what good is the money?

582
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:13,666
- So, no regrets about losing the money?
- No.

583
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:16,541
- Sure?
- Should I pen it with my blood?

584
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:17,916
Not at all.

585
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:22,625
Buggu, come in.

586
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,916
- I'm not going.
- Get inside.

587
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,208
All good.

588
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,833
- Why the hell did you lie?
- One part was true.

589
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,708
You did lose 150,000.

590
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:36,333
But do the math...

591
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:40,416
two ex-husbands,
two adult sons, spine in three pieces...

592
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,833
or 150,000 rupees?

593
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:46,375
Army saying...

594
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:50,000
"A big sorrow dwarfs small sorrows.

595
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:55,333
The world has great sorrow,
ours but a small woe."

596
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:56,708
Correct?

597
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:59,750
Give him a hug, sir.

598
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,916
Papa, sorry!

599
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:05,625
Buggu, my child.

600
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,000
Idiot!

601
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,833
End this nonsense forever.

602
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:26,000
Swear on your grandma,
you'll never think of going to England!

603
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:27,958
Take a vow!

604
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:31,375
Idiots! Why always swear in my name?

605
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:37,958
I, Buggu Lakhanpal,
swear if I even think of going to London...

606
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,750
my grandma dies.

607
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:44,250
May the departed rest in peace.

608
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,833
May the departed rest in peace.

609
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,250
May the departed rest in peace.

610
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,666
May the departed rest in peace.

611
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:04,291
Turn around!

612
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,541
- What?
- Turn around.

613
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,916
Banish the thought!

614
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:10,583
You swore on your grandma.

615
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,458
She's already dead.

616
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,333
Can't die again.

617
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:18,458
Hey, I need to pee badly.

618
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:20,000
Hold this, I'll be back.

619
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:21,250
She's quite light.

620
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,500
Got it? Good.

621
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,750
Buggu!

622
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:28,458
Is she dead?

623
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:31,041
No, just chilling. Getting fresh air.

624
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,416
I'm late for work.
When will he return?

625
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,250
He takes long leaks.

626
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,083
Hold this. I'll get him back.

627
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:46,166
- Where did he--
- Stay with Grandma.

628
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,458
We'll get them.

629
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:49,500
Your blood pressure will spike again.

630
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,791
- We don't want a double funeral.
- We'll bring them back.

631
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:54,166
Grandma!

632
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:57,083
Buggu, your mother will kill you.

633
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:59,083
Who leaves a funeral?

634
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:02,625
- There's 50% off on visas. Last day!
- Shut up.

635
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:05,166
You've been deceived before
in pursuit of a visa!

636
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:07,708
You want another <i>phoo-phoo?</i>

637
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:10,625
What do we do?
Comb bald heads for life?

638
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,166
We were born poor,
but we won't die poor.

639
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,375
Listen, I've promised Manu
I'll get her to England.

640
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,166
I'll send you both as well.

641
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:21,791
Soldier's promise!

642
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:23,500
Listen to my plan.

643
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,375
There's an English exam. IELTS.

644
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:31,125
Pass the exam, and you'll secure
a student visa for London!

645
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:32,750
Do you know English?

646
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,583
- Of course! I watch English films.
- Let's hear it.

647
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:38,041
Get lost, you piece of shit!

648
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,416
What does that mean?

649
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,041
Vanish, you lump of dump!

650
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,416
Oh, that's disgusting!

651
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
- Listen to this.
- Yes.

652
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:48,250
Let's rock the party, baby!
Let's rock the party!

653
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,208
- Let's rock the party-- Got it?
- No.

654
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,291
Come, daughter, let's throw rocks
at the party!

655
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:58,541
- I don't know English.
- Okay.

656
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:00,833
But I've gathered that you don't either.

657
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:02,833
You'll have to learn.

658
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:04,250
We'll learn.

659
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:07,166
How do you know about student visas?

660
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,291
When you were chasing visa agents,

661
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,541
I inquired at homes
with airplanes on their roofs.

662
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:18,875
They said that the surefire way to England
was through a student visa.

663
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,125
Now you need to find out
who is the best English teacher in Laltu.

664
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:30,208
Birmingham, here I come!

665
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,541
Birmingham, here I come!

666
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,250
Good morning, class!

667
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:38,000
What a lovely weather today!

668
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,166
Meet our new friends!
Mr. Hardy...

669
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,625
<i>Hardy also enrolled in Geetu's class</i>

670
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:47,583
<i>to protect us from any phoo-phoo.</i>

671
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:50,791
Geetu sir, what's the full name of IELTS?

672
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,250
Mummy was asking.

673
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:56,541
You're studying for IELTS,
and you don't know its full name?

674
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,000
Someone enlighten her mom.

675
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,500
Yes, Mr. Sukhi.

676
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,125
Will this be asked in the exam?

677
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,916
Who asks the exam name in the exam?

678
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,916
Then just teach us what they'll ask.

679
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:12,791
Your mummy is wasting our time!

680
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,541
I only have three months.

681
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,958
Please!
Teach me English quickly!

682
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,208
Sir, I want to go to the bathroom.

683
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:26,166
You bathe in bathrooms.
Don't pee there.

684
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:27,625
Hold the urine.

685
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,041
Where do you pee?

686
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,125
Where do you go for "uration"?

687
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:39,750
Geetu sir... library!

688
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:44,083
Laboratory. Please can I go?

689
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,583
You still hold the urine.

690
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,916
Lavatory.

691
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,125
How many more words
do we memorize?

692
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:00,125
- You sing songs?
- Yes, sir!

693
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,416
We remember hundreds of songs. How?

694
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,708
Put words to a tune,
and you never forget them.

695
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,375
<i>I want to go to the lavatory!</i>

696
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:13,083
<i>I want to go to the lavatory!</i>

697
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,375
<i>He wants to go to the lavatory!</i>

698
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,708
<i>He wants to go to the lavatory!</i>

699
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:20,458
Change the gender.
<i>She wants to go to the lavatory!</i>

700
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,333
<i>She wants to go to the lavatory!</i>

701
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:25,250
Plural.
<i>We want to go to the lavatory!</i>

702
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:28,250
<i>- We want to go to the lavatory!</i>
- Future tense.

703
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,666
<i>Shall I go to the lavatory?</i>

704
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:32,583
<i>Shall I go to the lavatory?</i>

705
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:33,625
Sir!

706
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,791
I don't want to go to the lavatory.

707
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:40,250
I've already done lavatory!

708
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,791
Oh, God! Disgusting.

709
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:47,833
Yes, Mr. Sukhi?

710
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,500
What's the problem?

711
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,166
How many words are there
in the dictionary?

712
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:55,125
Around 200,000 maybe.

713
00:41:55,833 --> 00:42:01,208
So we must sing 2000 songs a day
to learn English in 90 days.

714
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:02,916
How's it possible?

715
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,875
By the way, how many songs
are there in the world?

716
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,625
Ask your mummy!

717
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,916
Mr. Sukhi...

718
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:17,708
What's wrong with him? Always tense.
Please find out.

719
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:23,166
Army saying...
"Two ways to get someone to confess."

720
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,208
One, a fist punch.

721
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:29,916
The other...

722
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:32,750
rum punch.

723
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,416
<i>I want to go to the lavatory!</i>

724
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,250
<i>I want to go to the lavatory!</i>

725
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:43,041
<i>We want to go to the lavatory!</i>

726
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:45,875
<i>We want to go to the lavatory!</i>

727
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:50,750
My wedding was fixed with Jassi.

728
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:56,416
The engagement ceremony was done.

729
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:03,416
Then her daddy Chaddha
found Sheru Tidda.

730
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:07,375
A boy from London!

731
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:11,666
He cut me out.

732
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:16,416
He would not let me meet Jassi.

733
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:19,750
Then what happened?

734
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:21,875
What else?

735
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:24,833
The same old story.

736
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:29,958
London boys snatch away our girls.

737
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,125
Correct!

738
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,708
Her wedding was fixed.

739
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:34,208
I gate crashed.

740
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:36,458
Dead drunk... the uninvited guest.

741
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:38,875
To create a scene?

742
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:40,916
I would never embarrass my Jassi.

743
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:45,333
I went to see her one last time.

744
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:47,541
Did you cry?

745
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,541
If I cried, she'd also cry.

746
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:51,916
It would ruin her makeup.

747
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:54,916
I held back my tears then.

748
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:59,458
But when her plane flew over my house,

749
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:04,666
I cried my heart out.

750
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:13,333
- Why go to London now?
- That monster Tidda beats Jassi!

751
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:15,333
He ruptured her eardrum!

752
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:18,791
Jassi wrote to me,

753
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,000
"Sukhi, save me...

754
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,666
or I'll die."

755
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:29,291
I said, "Whatever it takes, I'm coming."

756
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:33,208
But my visa was rejected!

757
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:37,083
Then someone said,

758
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:41,666
"Learn English.
You'll get a student visa."

759
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,041
So here I am, learning!

760
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:48,250
<i>- I want to go to the lavatory!</i>
- Sukhi, be careful!

761
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:50,416
Sukhi, you might get hurt.

762
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:51,708
Stand up. What's wrong?

763
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:54,375
- Why doesn't Chaddha rescue his daughter?
- Hey, Chaddha!

764
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,916
He doesn't even answer her calls.

765
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:00,416
Where does this Chaddha live?

766
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:02,291
Across the temple.

767
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:20,916
Hey, Chaddha!

768
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:22,375
Out you come.

769
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:24,625
Open the door!

770
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:28,958
What's wrong with Punjabi boys

771
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:33,583
that you chase London grooms?

772
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:35,916
If you loathe us so much,

773
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:39,458
put up a signboard...

774
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:42,458
"Only London boys for our daughters.

775
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:44,625
Locals, go to hell!"

776
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,541
We swear we'll lock up our hearts!

777
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,625
But don't humiliate us.

778
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,541
I was on the horse as a groom...

779
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:59,208
and my bride eloped with a London boy.

780
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:03,125
I sat frozen on the horse.

781
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:09,833
A joker on the horse!

782
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:17,250
Even today,
people point at my house and say...

783
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:22,791
"Here lives the joker!"

784
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:24,458
Look at me!

785
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:30,625
The Joker of Pathankot!

786
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:36,250
Who says men don't hurt?

787
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,041
We do.

788
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:42,291
Men also feel pain.

789
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,208
We have a heart, a liver,

790
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,333
a kidney.

791
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:50,750
I agree. But this wisdom
could've waited till morning.

792
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:54,666
That villain in London
beats your daughter,

793
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:57,375
and you snooze merrily?

794
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,916
My daughter? I have no daughter.

795
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,541
You're not Chaddha?

796
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:06,041
No. Chaddha lives there.

797
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:10,083
Return my rock!

798
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,250
Crazy man.

799
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:16,000
Chaddha!

800
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:18,458
Come out!

801
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:20,041
- Out you come!
- Coach...

802
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:22,000
- Coach.
- Sir...

803
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:23,291
- Come out!
- Who is it?!

804
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:25,333
- Open the door, Chaddha.
- No, sir.

805
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:28,500
- Run! The lights have come on.
- Let's go.

806
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:45,583
Birmingham, here I come.

807
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:48,333
Birmingham, here I come.

808
00:47:48,541 --> 00:47:50,833
What a lovely weather today!

809
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,333
IELTS has four tests.

810
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:56,041
Reading, writing, listening, and speaking.

811
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,833
The most dangerous is the speaking test.

812
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:02,083
The examiner can give any topic and say,

813
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:04,625
"Speak for two minutes."

814
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,250
Yes, Mr. Sukhi?

815
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:10,541
I want to go to the lavatory.

816
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:11,958
Please proceed.

817
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:14,833
I don't want to go to the lavatory.

818
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:16,208
Then why ask?

819
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,791
Because I know
only these two lines in English.

820
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:21,125
They are over in two seconds.

821
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:25,375
A two-minute monologue
requires 70 to 80 lines.

822
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:27,041
How will we manage?

823
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:29,416
Practice, dear child.

824
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:31,541
Speak only in English.

825
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:34,041
Wear English clothes, watch English films,

826
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:37,500
and even snore in English.

827
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,583
Shall we begin, Mr. Hardy?!

828
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:46,041
Speak for two minutes on
"Roosters of Punjab."

829
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:47,750
Roosters?

830
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:51,208
The rooster is male,
and the female is a hen.

831
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:54,291
The horse is male,
and the female is a mare.

832
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:59,500
In Hindi, it's <i>horse-horsess,
rooster-roosteress...</i>

833
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:01,750
It's easy.

834
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:04,333
Why is English topsy-turvy?

835
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:06,041
Have mercy on English...

836
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:07,875
don't simplify it.

837
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:11,166
Language is to communicate.

838
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:14,333
Why fight simplicity?

839
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:18,041
Vocabulary is needed to communicate.

840
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:20,375
How will you communicate to a Brit that

841
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,375
Mr. Pumpi's English is good,

842
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:25,291
Mr. Buggu's English is better,

843
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:28,833
and Geetu's English is amazing?

844
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,958
How will you do it without words, smarty?

845
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:35,125
I'll communicate...

846
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:37,666
Oh, yeah.

847
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,250
Pumpi's English, <i>oye hoye.</i>

848
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:45,500
Buggu's English, <i>oye hoye hoye hoye.</i>

849
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:50,083
Geetu's English,
<i>oye hoye hoye hoye hoye!</i>

850
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:52,333
Wasn't that nice?

851
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:02,083
What a joker!

852
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:07,833
Certified joker!

853
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:26,666
Prized joker!

854
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:28,166
Shut up!

855
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:29,875
Stop laughing.

856
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:31,583
He's no joker.

857
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,125
He's here to learn.

858
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,000
Can't speak English, so goofed up.

859
00:50:35,458 --> 00:50:37,833
He's a master wrestler...
never goofs up there.

860
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:40,291
Wrestle him in his class.

861
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:43,666
You'll be the joker,
but he won't mock you.

862
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,958
He'll patiently continue teaching you.

863
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:48,833
That's a good teacher.

864
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:50,125
Not like you!

865
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:51,083
You're the joker!

866
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,375
All jokers!

867
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,166
With "S." In plural!

868
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,291
Damn your English. Let's go, Coach.

869
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:33,541
<i>I've been looted by your love
Totally rebooted by your love</i>

870
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:36,791
<i>O Manu... I'm someone new</i>

871
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:43,916
<i>I'll set up a home in your heart
A tornado can't take it apart</i>

872
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:47,375
<i>O Manu... I'm someone new</i>

873
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:54,916
<i>I was footloose and fancy-free
Till you suddenly happened to me</i>

874
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:59,000
<i>I was doing so okay
Till I came this way</i>

875
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:04,291
<i>I'm looted, rebooted</i>

876
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:06,958
<i>I'm looted, rebooted</i>

877
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,625
<i>Totally rerouted</i>

878
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:12,125
<i>In your love</i>

879
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:15,083
<i>I'm looted, rebooted</i>

880
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:17,458
<i>I'm looted, rebooted</i>

881
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,125
<i>Totally rerouted</i>

882
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:21,666
<i>In your love</i>

883
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:25,416
<i>I'm looted, rebooted</i>

884
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,041
<i>I'm looted, rebooted</i>

885
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:30,666
<i>Totally rerouted</i>

886
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,208
<i>In your love</i>

887
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:35,875
<i>In your love</i>

888
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,541
<i>In your love</i>

889
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:40,333
<i>In your love</i>

890
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:43,916
WATCH FILMS, LEARN ENGLISH

891
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:45,458
IELTS STUDENTS, LEARN ENGLISH

892
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:01,250
Hey, switch off the film!

893
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:03,208
- Why?
- Hold on.

894
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:07,541
- Shut up, you English scholars!
- But--

895
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:08,750
Silence!

896
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,458
What's wrong, Manu? Are you alright?

897
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:17,041
Look at him!
On his knees, asking his lady...

898
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:18,708
"Will you marry me?"

899
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:22,208
That's respect!

900
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:24,583
A match came home.

901
00:53:24,916 --> 00:53:26,375
Never bothered to propose.

902
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,291
Instead, went to my dad and said,

903
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:30,583
"Let's discuss the dowry."

904
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,625
I told the idiot, "Sure.

905
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:35,291
How much can you pay?"

906
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:38,166
You demanded the dowry from him?

907
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:40,875
What a role reversal!

908
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:44,125
Look at this man...
such respect!

909
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:48,250
If a man proposes so romantically...

910
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,875
how can a lady refuse?

911
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:53,541
All right, rewind and play.

912
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:55,375
Start from the chimes.

913
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:06,541
<i>Once I slept like a log
Now my mind is agog</i>

914
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,500
<i>I stay up and dream of you</i>

915
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:12,666
<i>Why, oh why, Manu?</i>

916
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:17,625
<i>Once I was shy
Now I ask passersby</i>

917
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:18,916
<i>How do you do?</i>

918
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:23,000
<i>Why, oh why, Manu?</i>

919
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:28,916
<i>My heart's new emotion
Raises the good old question</i>

920
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:33,125
<i>How did a guy doing so okay
Topple when he turned your way?</i>

921
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:35,541
<i>In your love</i>

922
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:38,708
<i>I'm looted, rebooted</i>

923
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:41,125
<i>I'm looted, rebooted</i>

924
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:43,750
<i>Totally rerouted</i>

925
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:46,083
<i>In your love</i>

926
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:49,166
<i>I'm looted, rebooted</i>

927
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,458
<i>I'm looted, rebooted</i>

928
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:54,208
<i>Totally rerouted</i>

929
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,625
<i>In your love</i>

930
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,625
<i>I'm looted, rebooted</i>

931
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:02,166
<i>I'm looted, rebooted</i>

932
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:04,708
<i>Totally rerouted</i>

933
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:06,083
<i>In your love</i>

934
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,666
<i>You are my earth, my sky</i>

935
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:13,458
<i>Without you, there is no I</i>

936
00:55:13,541 --> 00:55:15,583
<i>You've become my everything</i>

937
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:18,208
<i>The god I pray to, the prayer I sing</i>

938
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:23,291
<i>Every day I pray with folded hands
That your prayers come true</i>

939
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:26,000
<i>Though I fear you'll fly to foreign lands</i>

940
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:27,500
<i>And I'll be left without you</i>

941
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:29,041
<i>O Manu...</i>

942
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:32,083
{\an8}<i>O Manu...</i>

943
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:35,083
<i>O Manu...</i>

944
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,875
<i>I fear...</i>

945
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:42,625
<i>I'll be left</i>

946
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:47,166
<i>Without you</i>

947
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,333
<i>O Manu...</i>

948
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:53,500
Don't stare.

949
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:56,083
It's time to focus.

950
00:55:57,666 --> 00:55:59,541
Once we get our visa,
stare all you want.

951
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,791
Birmingham, here I come!

952
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,375
What a lovely weather today!

953
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,041
- What's going on?
- Sir...

954
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:15,833
give us any topic.

955
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:19,000
- We got our 70 English lines!
- No one fails.

956
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:21,750
Full Punjab goes to England!
Test us.

957
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,166
Okay.

958
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:26,416
Mr. Sukhi, speak for two minutes on...

959
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:28,666
Taj Mahal, Agra.

960
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:40,250
Sir, you want to test my knowledge about...

961
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:41,791
Taj Mahal, Agra.

962
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,166
Or check my English speaking skills?

963
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:45,666
My knowledge about

964
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,750
- Taj Mahal, Agra is limited,
- Taj Mahal, Agra.

965
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:50,666
but my knowledge
about the English language is unlimited.

966
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,125
I understand noun,

967
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:53,541
pronoun, adjective,

968
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:54,625
verb, adverb,

969
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:55,875
conjunction, colon,

970
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:57,666
semicolon, comma, and full stop.

971
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,791
I make conversation confidently
with any English person...

972
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,916
Prince Charles, wife Diana,
mother-in-law Queen Elizabeth Part II.

973
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:06,000
I find it very disturbing

974
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:09,666
that your esteemed organization
is trying to judge me

975
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,541
- by my knowledge about Taj Mahal, Agra...
- Taj Mahal, Agra!

976
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:14,750
and not by my English grammar.

977
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:17,291
You must re-examine
your examination system

978
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:19,500
because it is about English
and not about

979
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:21,416
- Taj Mahal, Agra!
- Taj Mahal, Agra!

980
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:29,750
- Geetu, turn around.
- Look behind you.

981
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:38,416
Whatever the topic in the exam,

982
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:40,916
this is the answer.

983
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,166
Memorize it thoroughly.

984
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,916
Replace the blanks with the topic.

985
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:51,250
Hundred topics, a hundred questions,
and just one answer.

986
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:53,291
Whose idea is it?

987
00:57:53,958 --> 00:57:54,916
Coach Hardy's.

988
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:58,041
I told you, he's no joker.

989
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,416
Mr. Hardy.

990
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,416
Yes, sir.

991
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:02,625
Thank you!

992
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:04,958
Memorize this thoroughly,

993
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:07,333
and the exam will be a piece of cake.

994
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:10,375
Will they give us cake in the exam?

995
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:13,041
"Piece of cake" means easy.

996
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:15,666
Now, go with confidence and say...

997
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,291
Birmingham, here I come!

998
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,708
Can I see your ID, please?

999
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:34,958
Yes.

1000
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:37,750
The pieces of cake.

1001
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:42,458
Thank you.

1002
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:44,583
Pull a chair.

1003
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:48,166
Pull?

1004
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,375
Okay?

1005
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:03,500
Pull it further?

1006
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:04,791
Take it outside?

1007
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:08,750
Give me a topic.
I'll speak for two minutes.

1008
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,458
Any topic. Give.

1009
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:13,208
No need for that.
We'll just have a conversation.

1010
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,333
What did you eat for breakfast
this morning?

1011
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:21,458
Today? I ate parathas.

1012
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:24,250
Describe how you make a paratha.

1013
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:25,666
In English.

1014
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:28,875
Paratha...

1015
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,875
<i>Aloo...</i>

1016
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:33,083
In English.

1017
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:34,666
Potato...

1018
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:36,958
Potato...

1019
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:40,000
Water...

1020
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:41,291
Fire...

1021
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:43,291
Potato in.

1022
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:45,375
Five minutes and the water starts to...

1023
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,125
Potato out.

1024
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:51,416
Smash the potato.

1025
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:54,500
Then... grab a roti.

1026
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,625
Enter potato.

1027
00:59:58,416 --> 00:59:59,666
Send to tandoor.

1028
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:01,583
Two minutes, paratha ready!

1029
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:03,458
Do you eat parathas every day?

1030
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,041
No, madam.

1031
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:06,541
On some days, paratha.

1032
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,208
On some days, I...

1033
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:12,208
What's it called...

1034
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:14,333
Round...

1035
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,666
I eat paratha every day, madam.

1036
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,000
I love paratha.

1037
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,083
Parathas. "S..."

1038
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:32,333
Plural.

1039
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:34,500
I eat many parathas.

1040
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:40,708
So, Mr. Kakkad,
what's your favorite hobby?

1041
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:47,000
My favorite hobby... is rooster.

1042
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:49,583
Eating rooster.

1043
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:52,208
Okay.

1044
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:56,125
Can you speak for two minutes
about "eating rooster"?

1045
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:58,041
Two minutes?

1046
01:01:00,916 --> 01:01:05,166
Sir, you want to check
my knowledge about eating rooster

1047
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:09,750
or do you want to check
my English speaking skills?

1048
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,208
My knowledge about
eating roosters is limited,

1049
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:16,125
but my knowledge about English
is unlimited.

1050
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:18,291
I understand noun, pronoun, verb,

1051
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:21,041
adjective, conjunction, semicolon,
colon, comma, and full stop.

1052
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:23,208
I make conversation
with any English people...

1053
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:26,041
Prince Charles, his wife Diana,
Queen Elizabeth number two.

1054
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:28,500
I find it disturbing
that your esteemed organization

1055
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:30,541
is trying to check my knowledge
about eating roosters

1056
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:31,916
and not my English grammar!

1057
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:35,666
You must re-examine
your examination system.

1058
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:41,750
Because this is about English
and not about rooster eating.

1059
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:47,583
Okay?

1060
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:49,541
Okay.

1061
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:53,041
{\an8}Can you tell me what is wrong
with this sentence?

1062
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:55,083
Sure.

1063
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:58,333
"Yesterday,

1064
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:05,208
{\an8}my father
and mother was in the bar."

1065
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,041
No! No way.

1066
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:13,291
My mother and father no go bar.

1067
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,458
Father some-some go.

1068
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:19,958
{\an8}Mother... no! Never!

1069
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:27,125
{\an8}Yesterday, my father and mother
<i>were</i> in the bar.

1070
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:28,333
Your parents?

1071
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,083
{\an8}Your mother swigs as well? Amazing!

1072
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:33,791
Cheers to your mummy!

1073
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:36,083
It's good to know.

1074
01:02:36,291 --> 01:02:40,083
You're being so frank...
I'll tell you a secret.

1075
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:44,541
Yesterday, I was in the bar.

1076
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:46,583
I was stressed for the exam.

1077
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:48,583
So, 30ml in, all stress out.

1078
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:49,958
Thank you.

1079
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:55,875
Can you tell me about your family
for two minutes?

1080
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:00,750
You want to test
my knowledge about my family...

1081
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:04,333
or you want to test my knowledge
about my English speaking skills?

1082
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:07,833
My knowledge about my family is limited.

1083
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:09,041
- Limited?
- Limited.

1084
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:12,166
I'm not asking about
Winston Churchill's family.

1085
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:15,500
I'm asking about yours.
You should know.

1086
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:17,916
Again for... two minutes.

1087
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,291
My... my family?

1088
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:21,583
Two minutes?

1089
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:23,500
That's easy... I'll tell you.

1090
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:25,125
Sir...

1091
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:27,458
Sir...

1092
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:29,708
My father...

1093
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:32,250
dead.

1094
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:33,583
So sorry.

1095
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:35,208
My mother...

1096
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:37,791
dead.

1097
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:42,166
My mother's mother... dead.

1098
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:45,708
My father's mother... dead.

1099
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:48,208
All dead...

1100
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:49,916
Dead.

1101
01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:53,375
My mother's older sister...

1102
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:55,541
You know... aunt?

1103
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:57,208
You know!

1104
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,208
Dead?

1105
01:03:58,625 --> 01:03:59,500
Dead.

1106
01:04:01,708 --> 01:04:04,041
- How many more do I kill?
- That's enough.

1107
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:06,666
Now, you can go.

1108
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,125
Sir, just a minute.

1109
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,875
I still have 90 seconds.

1110
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:11,541
Let the dead rest in peace.

1111
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:13,416
Listen to the story of the living.

1112
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:18,958
My only family is four stubborn fools
who want to go to London.

1113
01:04:19,416 --> 01:04:21,583
One of them is a girl, Manu.

1114
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:24,250
Her life is a saga of troubles.

1115
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:27,125
She learns English... wrestling...

1116
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:29,750
not for herself, but for her family.

1117
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:32,833
She takes on the world...

1118
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:36,125
for me!

1119
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:40,000
No one has ever stood up for me.

1120
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:45,291
So she's become my girl... friend.

1121
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:46,875
- Really?
- Yes.

1122
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:49,875
The earlier one dumped me
on our wedding day.

1123
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:55,291
I could never fall in love again.

1124
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,333
- You know how it is.
- Yes.

1125
01:04:57,416 --> 01:04:59,958
- Love just withers away. Right?
- I agree.

1126
01:05:00,416 --> 01:05:03,583
After years, love has blossomed again.

1127
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:08,250
So, when will you tell her?
When she's in London?

1128
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:09,416
That's the plan!

1129
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:13,458
At Big Ben, on my knees,
I'll present the ring with a flourish,

1130
01:05:13,791 --> 01:05:15,291
look into her eyes, and ask...

1131
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,333
"Will you marry Hardy Singh?"

1132
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:20,875
I do.

1133
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:25,375
Sir, you too must've loved?

1134
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,375
- I have. Once.
- Once?

1135
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:28,958
Just once.

1136
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:31,625
My fate is in your hands. Save me.

1137
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,250
- What are you saying?
- Please, sir.

1138
01:05:33,416 --> 01:05:36,416
I will name our first child after you.

1139
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:38,291
- What...
- I promise.

1140
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:40,500
What's your name? Tell me.

1141
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:44,541
Vangipurapu Venkata Kuppu.

1142
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:49,375
No problem. Can you write it down?

1143
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:51,125
Consider it done.

1144
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:56,000
Shall I consider our result "Done"?

1145
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:59,541
Are you tense, Mr. Sukhi?

1146
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,208
Good question, sir.

1147
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:05,125
Past tense or present tense, sir?

1148
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:09,458
I'm just asking if you're anxious.

1149
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:15,125
You understand the word "anxious"?

1150
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:19,500
Stressed?

1151
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,375
Nervous?

1152
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:23,333
Terrified?

1153
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:26,375
You don't know any of these words?

1154
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:28,958
No, sir.

1155
01:06:31,916 --> 01:06:33,416
Send the next one in.

1156
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:38,916
Okay, Mr. Sukhi. You may go.

1157
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:42,041
Go? No, sir.

1158
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:43,625
No... go. Please, sir.

1159
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,375
You're done. Leave.

1160
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:46,625
Wait a minute!

1161
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,208
Sir, take a two-minute speaking test.
Any topic.

1162
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:51,250
I pass, sir.

1163
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:55,041
How will you live in England
without any English?

1164
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:57,458
He lives here!
Does he know any Punjabi?

1165
01:06:57,666 --> 01:07:00,750
A Brit like him rejected my visa.

1166
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:05,000
Grilled me about education,
savings, job... but not my need!

1167
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:09,250
Explain to him... I won't stay there.

1168
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:12,416
I don't want to live in England.

1169
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:16,333
Airport to Jassi's house...
and back with her.

1170
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:18,333
Won't even stop for a sip of water.
Make him understand!

1171
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:23,916
Don't cling to rules. Understand feelings.

1172
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,625
Jassi in London... only hope... me!

1173
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:29,083
Don't kill hope, sir.

1174
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,291
Please, sir.

1175
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:34,625
Please understand feeling, sir.

1176
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:42,000
{\an8}<i>IELTS results were first obtained
by liquor shops.</i>

1177
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:45,041
<i>Shop owners paid bribes to get them.</i>

1178
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:47,333
<i>Those who passed drank in joy.</i>

1179
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:50,416
<i>Those who failed
drank even more in sorrow.</i>

1180
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:51,833
Coach, the results are out.

1181
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:03,958
Move aside... Chameli... Pumpi...

1182
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:13,291
He must have failed!

1183
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,833
Balli has failed. He's in shock.

1184
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:26,083
Failing can't shock him.
Check, he must've passed.

1185
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:32,458
Move! Move aside!

1186
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:35,666
<i>Coach Hardy was right.</i>

1187
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:37,375
<i>Balli had passed.</i>

1188
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:40,333
<i>We weren't fortunate enough to faint.</i>

1189
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:42,250
<i>The rest of us had failed.</i>

1190
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:51,916
<i>The whir of the sewing machine
at Balli's house...</i>

1191
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:54,083
<i>was replaced by drumbeats of joy.</i>

1192
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:56,375
Balli Kakkad going to London!

1193
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,041
Balli Kakkad going to London!

1194
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:01,916
{\an8}Balli Kakkad going to London!

1195
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:05,541
- Balli, get here.
- Congratulations.

1196
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,500
Congratulations! Here you go.

1197
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,375
{\an8}English is a window to the world.

1198
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:14,000
{\an8}And Geetu's class is the door to England!

1199
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,958
Enter my class, exit in London.

1200
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,583
Like our Balli Kakkad.

1201
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:20,833
Our results are 90 percent--

1202
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:23,750
{\an8}Pass or fail?

1203
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,583
{\an8}Show our mugshots as well. The failures.

1204
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:27,958
I'm Sukhi Singh.

1205
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:30,458
I can't go to London because I failed!

1206
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,375
This is Manu Randhawa... failed!

1207
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:35,666
- Buggu Lakhanpal... failed!
- What are you doing?

1208
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:37,375
Coach Hardy... failed!

1209
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:42,541
His success videos make us dream
and lure us to join his class.

1210
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:44,208
Now sing... "What a lovely weather today."

1211
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:45,708
{\an8}- Sukhi... Hold this.
- Brother...

1212
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,500
{\an8}Our lives are in limbo.

1213
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:49,625
Sukhi!

1214
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:51,041
His business is flourishing!

1215
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:54,500
{\an8}- I borrowed money to pay your fee!
- Come with me.

1216
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:55,666
I need to go to London.

1217
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,916
- Tidda will kill Jassi.
- Nothing will happen to her.

1218
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,958
Balli will meet Jassi.

1219
01:10:01,291 --> 01:10:02,500
We've given him the address.

1220
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:04,750
He'll get you to speak to Jassi.

1221
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:06,875
Calm down or I'll give you one.

1222
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:08,875
Patience, brother.

1223
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,333
- Leave for the airport.
- Yes.

1224
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:12,333
{\an8}- Hold this.
- Yes.

1225
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:15,041
{\an8}- Go! You'll miss your flight.
- Yes.

1226
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:18,208
{\an8}Meet Jassi as soon as you land.
Call us.

1227
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:20,083
{\an8}We'll wait by the public phone.

1228
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:21,625
{\an8}- Bye!
- Take care.

1229
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:23,875
You bloody...

1230
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:27,791
You knew we can't learn English
in 90 days!

1231
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:29,458
- What are you doing?
- Yet you made me...

1232
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:31,958
- Sukhi!
- promise Jassi, "I'm coming!"

1233
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:34,750
- Swindler!
- That's enough! Come with me!

1234
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Balli will meet Jassi tomorrow.
They'll call.

1235
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:55,083
Staring at the phone
won't make it ring.

1236
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:58,041
London calling, I telling you.

1237
01:10:58,333 --> 01:10:59,750
Go. Relax!

1238
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:12,583
Sukhi.

1239
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:18,208
Geetu, no fights.

1240
01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:23,375
You flung this sandal here.

1241
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:26,166
It hit here.

1242
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:29,916
Pack your bags.

1243
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:32,500
You're going to London.

1244
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:36,083
- How?
<i>- Dunki.</i>

1245
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:38,708
<i>Dunki?</i> What's that?

1246
01:11:39,458 --> 01:11:41,791
A "donkey route" to London.

1247
01:11:42,416 --> 01:11:44,291
Without a visa. Illegally.

1248
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:49,291
Crossing borders,
jungles, mountains, seas.

1249
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:51,708
Border police can open fire.

1250
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:56,250
The odds of making it is... 25 percent.

1251
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:59,708
So why send him to die?

1252
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:02,916
If he stays here, he dies a 100 percent!

1253
01:12:03,916 --> 01:12:04,958
Take the chance.

1254
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:06,666
What will it cost?

1255
01:12:07,041 --> 01:12:08,333
I have paid up.

1256
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:09,500
Geetu Gulati,

1257
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:13,958
you're less of a swindler than you look.

1258
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,291
- Thank you.
- Sukhi!

1259
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:22,375
London calling. Come!

1260
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:24,083
Go fast!

1261
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:26,916
Tell Jassi, Sukhi's coming.

1262
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:31,916
Jassi?

1263
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:33,458
Jassi, I'm coming to London!

1264
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:35,750
Can you hear me?

1265
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:37,708
- Hello?
<i>- Sukhi, listen...</i>

1266
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,250
Where's Jassi?

1267
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:44,791
<i>News that you failed reached Jassi.</i>

1268
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:49,041
<i>Jassi killed herself.</i>

1269
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:54,791
<i>Hello? Sukhi?</i>

1270
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:56,250
<i>Hello?!</i>

1271
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:57,791
<i>Sukhi?</i>

1272
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:00,708
<i>Save me!</i>

1273
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:04,833
<i>Tidda hits me every day.</i>

1274
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:08,708
<i>Sukhi, come to London and save me.</i>

1275
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:12,000
{\an8}Hello?

1276
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:17,041
{\an8}<i>Why ask</i>

1277
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:22,625
{\an8}<i>After this shattered soul?</i>

1278
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:30,250
{\an8}<i>Why speak of misfortune</i>

1279
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:35,916
{\an8}<i>And its toll</i>

1280
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:42,250
{\an8}<i>Why speak of misfortune</i>

1281
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:48,458
{\an8}<i>And its toll...</i>

1282
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:55,375
{\an8}<i>Why ask</i>

1283
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:59,291
{\an8}- Sukhi!
<i>- After this shattered soul?</i>

1284
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:00,791
{\an8}Sukhi!

1285
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:11,416
{\an8}Tell Papa, I got my visa.

1286
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,375
{\an8}My friend...

1287
01:14:12,666 --> 01:14:18,583
{\an8}I'm on my way... to meet Jassi.

1288
01:14:20,875 --> 01:14:25,375
{\an8}<i>No feeling left</i>

1289
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:29,083
{\an8}<i>Except for grief</i>

1290
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:30,750
{\an8}Sukhi!

1291
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:33,708
{\an8}Sukhi!

1292
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:38,541
{\an8}<i>For this ceaseless pain</i>

1293
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:42,958
{\an8}<i>The end is relief...</i>

1294
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:52,375
<i>For this ceaseless pain
The end is relief</i>

1295
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:58,541
<i>Why ask after this shattered soul...</i>

1296
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:00,666
Sukhi wanted to meet Jassi.

1297
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:05,208
Was barred because
he couldn't speak English.

1298
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:10,666
The British ruled us for a century.

1299
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:15,250
When they arrived we never asked,

1300
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:17,250
"Know any Hindi?

1301
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:19,916
How good is your vocabulary?"

1302
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:23,083
Never demanded speaking tests.

1303
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:28,000
We didn't test them.
How dare they test us?

1304
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:31,333
Tenses, plurals...

1305
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,416
The rooster is male, the female is hen...

1306
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,250
Sukhi died cramming it all.

1307
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:39,958
Dead!

1308
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:45,083
His dreams were reduced to ashes!

1309
01:15:58,875 --> 01:15:59,833
Manu...

1310
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:02,875
you'll get your home back.

1311
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:07,291
Don't ever think of suicide.

1312
01:16:07,833 --> 01:16:10,083
I'll take you to England.

1313
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:14,625
Buggu, I'll take you all.

1314
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:19,166
We'll scatter Sukhi's ashes near Jassi.

1315
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:23,625
We don't have a visa...
but try stopping us!

1316
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:25,416
We will go to England.

1317
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:28,458
Let's see who stops us.

1318
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:31,500
I have decided.

1319
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:35,250
We will take the <i>dunki</i> route.

1320
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:36,708
Come here.

1321
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:40,250
We will <i>dunki.</i>

1322
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:46,750
<i>The land of my birth says</i>

1323
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:53,666
<i>Child, don't go</i>

1324
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:58,000
<i>But when fate forces your hand</i>

1325
01:16:58,791 --> 01:17:05,500
<i>The feet can't say no</i>

1326
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:09,416
<i>Hardy was a man possessed.</i>

1327
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:14,208
<i>He sold off his home and land
to pay the agents,</i>

1328
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:15,791
<i>and we set out on our journey.</i>

1329
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:20,833
<i>Pumpi, Chameli,
and her brother Gulab joined us.</i>

1330
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:25,833
<i>With dreams packed in our backpacks,
we all embarked on the journey.</i>

1331
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:28,500
I'll get you to Pakistan.

1332
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:33,000
Then, another agent will take you to Iran
via Afghanistan in a truck.

1333
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:35,583
From Iran, you'll take a train to Turkey.

1334
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:37,291
Finally, you'll travel by sea to London.

1335
01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:41,708
Will we pass through China on the route?
I'd love to visit!

1336
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:45,541
Ignore him.

1337
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:47,833
Give me all the agents' numbers.

1338
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:51,666
- Sure. This has all the numbers.
- Okay.

1339
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,083
Get in the boat.

1340
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:54,291
Wait.

1341
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:56,541
Let me take one last look.

1342
01:17:57,958 --> 01:17:59,458
I'm unsure if I'll come back.

1343
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:05,000
<i>Farewell sweet homeland
We'll be back soon</i>

1344
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:10,791
<i>And talk from midnight
Till it is noon</i>

1345
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:16,541
<i>Farewell sweet homeland
We'll be back soon</i>

1346
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:22,208
<i>And talk from midnight
Till it is noon</i>

1347
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:28,291
<i>Your rain-scented soil
I carry along</i>

1348
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:33,833
<i>Of your remembrance
I've woven a song</i>

1349
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:39,666
<i>A kerchief of your clouds
Is tied around my brow</i>

1350
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:44,708
<i>A blanket of your memories
Warms me even now</i>

1351
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:45,666
What's that?

1352
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:50,708
<i>In your keeping
I've left my heart</i>

1353
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:56,416
<i>There it stays
Though we part</i>

1354
01:18:56,875 --> 01:19:01,208
<i>Farewell sweet homeland
We'll be back soon</i>

1355
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:04,541
- Stop the boat.
<i>- And talk from midnight</i>

1356
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:08,375
<i>- Till it is noon</i>
- It's a watchtower.

1357
01:19:10,416 --> 01:19:12,958
Wasn't there last month.

1358
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,250
We have to turn back.

1359
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:18,166
We won't turn back!

1360
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:22,541
- The boat won't go ahead.
- But we will.

1361
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:23,666
How?

1362
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,916
<i>We walked underwater all night.</i>

1363
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:25,083
<i>By morning, we were in Pakistan.</i>

1364
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:55,625
Never do that again.

1365
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:56,875
What?

1366
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:02,625
For my breath, don't stop yours.

1367
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:09,250
All's well.

1368
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:13,166
All's well.

1369
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:17,083
Let's go to the next agent.

1370
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:19,541
How much further is London?

1371
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:23,083
Think how far,
and you won't make it.

1372
01:22:24,916 --> 01:22:27,458
Think about what awaits you.

1373
01:22:28,375 --> 01:22:29,291
Take a look.

1374
01:22:33,291 --> 01:22:37,791
<i>In six months, Balli had bought
a house and car.</i>

1375
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,708
<i>Pumpi, Chameli, and Gulab perked up.</i>

1376
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:43,583
Get your bags!

1377
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:03,750
<i>A sentence in your story</i>

1378
01:23:04,333 --> 01:23:07,250
<i>Is all I ask to be</i>

1379
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:12,166
<i>In your quiet moments</i>

1380
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:15,583
<i>Spare a thought for me</i>

1381
01:23:15,916 --> 01:23:20,416
<i>Your destination is my destiny</i>

1382
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:23,625
<i>My friend</i>

1383
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:28,583
<i>The refuge of your arms</i>

1384
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:32,000
<i>Is my journey's end</i>

1385
01:23:32,791 --> 01:23:36,833
<i>Oh, my love</i>

1386
01:23:36,916 --> 01:23:41,166
<i>Oh, my love</i>

1387
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:47,083
<i>My heart will always be true
I'll be there forever for you</i>

1388
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:49,166
<i>Oh, my love</i>

1389
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:53,250
<i>Oh, my love</i>

1390
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:57,541
<i>Oh, my love...</i>

1391
01:23:57,666 --> 01:24:03,625
<i>My heart will always be true
I'll be there forever for you</i>

1392
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:06,791
<i>Oh, my love...</i>

1393
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:10,250
<i>Vehicles changed, and the journey went on...</i>

1394
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:15,791
<i>Bullets and bombs were never far.</i>

1395
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:23,666
<i>It took us two months</i>

1396
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:28,041
<i>to cross Afghanistan and reach Iran.</i>

1397
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:32,208
Come fast!

1398
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:35,041
Move!

1399
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:37,791
Move! Move fast!

1400
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:50,666
<i>We had to walk for two days
through the desert for a train to Turkey.</i>

1401
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:10,208
Look straight. Keep walking.

1402
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:16,041
Stop!

1403
01:25:34,125 --> 01:25:35,458
- Okay.
- No.

1404
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:37,166
Go, go.

1405
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:40,375
Pumpi, Chameli, Gulab... stop!
He'll kill you.

1406
01:25:40,458 --> 01:25:41,375
Coach!

1407
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:43,291
- Stay down!
- No, please.

1408
01:25:43,541 --> 01:25:45,041
- Stay down.
- No, please.

1409
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:09,708
Hurry!

1410
01:26:18,458 --> 01:26:19,333
Run!

1411
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:34,666
Chameli!

1412
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:39,041
Chameli! Open your eyes!

1413
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:40,291
Get up, Chameli!

1414
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:46,791
No.

1415
01:27:49,208 --> 01:27:50,125
Come.

1416
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,958
- No. I won't, Coach.
- We'll all die.

1417
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:56,125
- Move!
- No.

1418
01:27:56,208 --> 01:27:57,083
- Buggu...
- Coach...

1419
01:27:57,166 --> 01:27:58,125
- Come.
- Coach...

1420
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,083
Enough!

1421
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:42,083
Boss.

1422
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:54,791
Hey, let go of me!

1423
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:09,208
Let my boss go or he dies!

1424
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:14,791
- Drop the gun!
- He'll kill me!

1425
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:18,250
Drop it!

1426
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:20,750
Save me.

1427
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:22,041
I'll shoot him!

1428
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,000
Hey!

1429
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:26,583
He'll kill me.

1430
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:30,750
Okay.

1431
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:42,000
Let's go, Manu.

1432
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:47,500
Manu, let's go.

1433
01:30:48,125 --> 01:30:49,250
Move, Manu.

1434
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,750
- Coach--
- Get up. Be with her.

1435
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:57,833
Manu.

1436
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,333
- Come on, move.
- Manu...

1437
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:00,541
Are you fine?

1438
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:16,541
<i>Farewell sweet homeland</i>

1439
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:23,583
<i>We'll be back soon</i>

1440
01:31:24,958 --> 01:31:30,333
<i>And talk from midnight</i>

1441
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:37,708
<i>Till it is noon</i>

1442
01:31:39,208 --> 01:31:43,833
<i>Farewell sweet homeland</i>

1443
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:49,541
<i>We'll be back soon</i>

1444
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:02,166
Comb your hair.

1445
01:32:07,666 --> 01:32:09,000
It's okay... no need.
You look pretty.

1446
01:32:20,416 --> 01:32:21,625
It's all right.

1447
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:25,375
It's okay.

1448
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,708
I'm doing this for my house.

1449
01:32:29,833 --> 01:32:33,875
Why are you risking your life?

1450
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:35,291
I'm crazy for you.

1451
01:32:36,541 --> 01:32:38,041
Can't you see?

1452
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:41,291
Since when?

1453
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:44,833
Since you fought for me in class.

1454
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:46,666
Why didn't you tell me?

1455
01:32:46,791 --> 01:32:50,750
You said, "Don't stare! Focus."

1456
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:53,208
- So I'm focusing.
- Till when?

1457
01:32:53,541 --> 01:32:56,375
Only till London.

1458
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:58,791
At Big Ben

1459
01:32:59,666 --> 01:33:00,666
when it chimes...

1460
01:33:06,416 --> 01:33:07,791
That's when I'll stop focusing.

1461
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:12,250
<i>The refuge of your arms</i>

1462
01:33:12,791 --> 01:33:15,666
<i>Nothing can replace</i>

1463
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:20,750
<i>My only home</i>

1464
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:24,125
<i>Now is your embrace</i>

1465
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:28,875
<i>Oh, my love</i>

1466
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:33,125
<i>Oh, my love...</i>

1467
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:39,125
<i>My heart will always be true
I'll be there forever for you</i>

1468
01:33:39,416 --> 01:33:41,208
<i>Oh, my love</i>

1469
01:33:41,291 --> 01:33:45,250
<i>Oh, my love</i>

1470
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:49,500
<i>Oh, my love...</i>

1471
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:56,541
<i>My heart will always be true
I'll be there forever for you</i>

1472
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,708
<i>When we got on the container for England,</i>

1473
01:34:01,583 --> 01:34:03,916
<i>we hoped to breathe easy.</i>

1474
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:08,083
<i>But in there, every breath was torture.</i>

1475
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:11,625
<i>We were locked in for 27 days.</i>

1476
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,833
<i>It was like living in a gutter.</i>

1477
01:34:20,708 --> 01:34:23,500
<i>Just one hope kept us going...</i>

1478
01:34:24,541 --> 01:34:25,416
{\an8}<i>London.</i>

1479
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:32,333
{\an8}<i>Packing the saga of this journey</i>

1480
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:41,625
<i>All sorrows and the agony</i>

1481
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:49,833
<i>O sweet homeland...</i>

1482
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:58,708
<i>- To heal, we shall come to you soon</i>
- Come on!

1483
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:07,416
<i>- And talk from midnight till it is noon</i>
- Fast! Let's go!

1484
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:11,291
<i>O sweet homeland!</i>

1485
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:12,583
Get up fast!

1486
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:15,625
<i>- O sweet homeland!</i>
- Get up.

1487
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:17,000
Hurry up!

1488
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:20,083
<i>- O sweet homeland!</i>
- Let's go!

1489
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:21,708
Come on!

1490
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:23,083
- Leave!
- Let's go!

1491
01:35:23,166 --> 01:35:24,208
That way!

1492
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:25,166
Go!

1493
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:26,125
That way.

1494
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:32,666
We're clear.

1495
01:35:36,166 --> 01:35:37,041
Where are we?

1496
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:38,750
Doesn't look like London.

1497
01:35:39,666 --> 01:35:42,958
The swindlers got us to Africa!

1498
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:44,708
Look there.

1499
01:35:46,041 --> 01:35:46,916
Those people...

1500
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:48,541
Hold on a second.

1501
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:56,208
Madam...

1502
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:58,541
What country... this?

1503
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:03,166
It's a Siberian Husky. From Russia.

1504
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,666
Not the dog.

1505
01:36:05,125 --> 01:36:09,541
This... what country this?

1506
01:36:09,791 --> 01:36:11,875
It was England when I last checked.

1507
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:13,208
London!

1508
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:16,250
- We've reached London!
- We are here!

1509
01:36:16,791 --> 01:36:19,791
- We've reached!
- We are here!

1510
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,750
- London!
- We've reached!

1511
01:36:22,916 --> 01:36:24,958
These foreigners are a nuisance.

1512
01:36:26,333 --> 01:36:29,541
She called me a foreigner!
Mom says the same.

1513
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:33,625
- Oh, my!
-"My fair boy looks like a foreigner."

1514
01:36:33,708 --> 01:36:34,583
Right!

1515
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,666
- I made for London!
- London!

1516
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:43,958
- We made it! London!
- London!

1517
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:50,750
I can't see Big Ben.

1518
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,083
Coach!

1519
01:37:22,708 --> 01:37:23,625
Oh, man!

1520
01:37:23,708 --> 01:37:27,500
Balli is famous!
They've made his statue!

1521
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:30,500
Look at the culture!

1522
01:37:30,666 --> 01:37:34,583
We never erect statues of foreigners.

1523
01:37:34,708 --> 01:37:36,375
What a culture!

1524
01:37:39,708 --> 01:37:40,625
Money offerings!

1525
01:37:40,916 --> 01:37:43,333
Never happens back home!

1526
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,916
Culture!

1527
01:37:48,208 --> 01:37:55,083
Even Balli's armpit odor is replicated!

1528
01:37:55,166 --> 01:37:57,916
Meticulous culture!

1529
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:06,708
Balli?

1530
01:38:06,791 --> 01:38:07,708
Coach.

1531
01:38:08,458 --> 01:38:09,333
Coach.

1532
01:38:11,375 --> 01:38:13,583
- You're begging?
- Coach, no.

1533
01:38:18,916 --> 01:38:22,500
- Beggars manage to buy houses here?
- Shut up!

1534
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:26,041
Must be rented. What's the rent?

1535
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:29,041
Hired staff, as well!

1536
01:38:30,333 --> 01:38:31,250
Come in.

1537
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:37,166
- Isn't that too much staff?
- Shut up!

1538
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:38,500
- Hi, Balli.
- What's up?

1539
01:38:40,875 --> 01:38:44,333
They're all <i>dunkers...</i>
from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh.

1540
01:38:44,666 --> 01:38:46,541
We share the rent.

1541
01:38:46,916 --> 01:38:50,166
They've come from my hometown.

1542
01:38:50,541 --> 01:38:54,541
Till they find a place,
they'll bunk here.

1543
01:39:01,041 --> 01:39:02,541
You have a student visa.

1544
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,500
Why live this life?

1545
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:08,416
There's no college. It's a fake admission.

1546
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:10,041
If caught, it's prison.

1547
01:39:18,583 --> 01:39:19,958
- Come here!
- Yes, Coach?

1548
01:39:23,208 --> 01:39:24,166
Where's this house?

1549
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:30,000
Where's your car? Where's it?

1550
01:39:30,625 --> 01:39:33,875
Such photos lure others.

1551
01:39:34,458 --> 01:39:35,750
They die at borders.

1552
01:39:36,125 --> 01:39:40,708
Send real photos... of you begging!

1553
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:44,083
Fine.

1554
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:46,208
I'll send real photos.

1555
01:39:47,166 --> 01:39:49,250
Mom will be thrilled, her son begs!

1556
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,458
I earn 20 pounds a day.

1557
01:39:52,708 --> 01:39:53,958
Six hundred a month.

1558
01:39:54,416 --> 01:39:56,541
I keep 100 and send 500 home.

1559
01:39:57,041 --> 01:39:59,458
Mom thinks I'm the King of London.

1560
01:40:00,166 --> 01:40:03,458
Now, she takes tea breaks when she sews.

1561
01:40:03,916 --> 01:40:04,916
She says...

1562
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:12,041
"Relatives listen when I offer my opinion,
thanks to you.

1563
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:13,916
Because you're in London."

1564
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:16,958
Wreck it all with one photo?

1565
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:21,208
None of us send real photos.

1566
01:40:21,666 --> 01:40:24,541
If they learn we clean gutters,

1567
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:26,916
our money will stink.

1568
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:29,000
They won't touch it.

1569
01:40:32,166 --> 01:40:33,041
Listen...

1570
01:40:33,333 --> 01:40:36,458
I came here for a better life.
Didn't work out.

1571
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:39,250
But my family is better off.

1572
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:42,083
What was my life anyway?

1573
01:40:42,916 --> 01:40:44,625
I was combing bald heads.

1574
01:40:45,041 --> 01:40:46,333
Don't hit me.

1575
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:50,208
Cops!
Hit me... but inside.

1576
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:53,500
- Stop.
- Cops!

1577
01:40:53,958 --> 01:40:54,833
Come here.

1578
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:57,791
<i>This wasn't the London of our dreams.</i>

1579
01:40:58,458 --> 01:41:01,958
<i>Twenty people shared one toilet.</i>

1580
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:09,000
<i>Every day, a truck arrived for laborers.</i>

1581
01:41:09,708 --> 01:41:11,458
<i>The strong were hired.</i>

1582
01:41:12,083 --> 01:41:14,041
<i>The weak were rejected.</i>

1583
01:41:14,791 --> 01:41:15,916
Hello, good evening.

1584
01:41:16,083 --> 01:41:17,625
<i>Not that there was no work.</i>

1585
01:41:17,875 --> 01:41:18,750
<i>There was.</i>

1586
01:41:20,375 --> 01:41:21,916
{\an8}<i>We sold adult films</i>

1587
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:25,708
<i>and cleaned stores and toilets.</i>

1588
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:30,416
<i>But our main job was to dodge cops.</i>

1589
01:42:32,791 --> 01:42:33,708
Let's go, Manu.

1590
01:42:34,416 --> 01:42:35,291
Yes, let's go!

1591
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:37,375
Where are we going?

1592
01:42:38,083 --> 01:42:39,208
Back to India.

1593
01:42:41,041 --> 01:42:42,916
Back to India?
What do you mean?

1594
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:45,958
This isn't the place we imagined.

1595
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:50,416
If you're sick,
you can't see a doctor.

1596
01:42:51,083 --> 01:42:53,583
If harassed, you can't go to the cops.

1597
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:58,291
No bank account, no driving license...
Because we have no ID.

1598
01:42:59,416 --> 01:43:02,166
We don't exist for them!

1599
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:04,666
We'll always be illegal on this land.

1600
01:43:05,083 --> 01:43:06,000
Why?

1601
01:43:06,333 --> 01:43:08,291
Did they produce
this land in a factory?

1602
01:43:09,583 --> 01:43:10,875
It's God's land.

1603
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,375
As much ours as theirs.

1604
01:43:14,166 --> 01:43:17,208
They made borders!
Our land, your land.

1605
01:43:17,833 --> 01:43:20,166
We're here because they were there.

1606
01:43:20,458 --> 01:43:22,166
Looted our country for centuries!

1607
01:43:22,833 --> 01:43:24,958
Why else would we come here?

1608
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:32,625
We risked our lives to get here...
we can't go back.

1609
01:43:33,166 --> 01:43:36,125
Now, this is our city!

1610
01:43:36,208 --> 01:43:38,583
In our city, we wouldn't have to sleep
in a graveyard.

1611
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:43,708
Many homes would open their doors to us
and welcome us in!

1612
01:43:44,125 --> 01:43:45,333
Why suffer humiliations?

1613
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:51,375
Give me one reason to stay back, Manu.

1614
01:43:55,041 --> 01:43:56,000
I'll give you a reason.

1615
01:44:00,958 --> 01:44:01,958
Stay back for me.

1616
01:44:05,041 --> 01:44:06,166
You're my man.

1617
01:44:07,291 --> 01:44:08,791
I want to spend my life with you.

1618
01:44:12,708 --> 01:44:13,666
Stay on.

1619
01:44:17,666 --> 01:44:21,500
<i>After that, Hardy never
spoke of going back to India.</i>

1620
01:44:22,208 --> 01:44:24,583
<i>He looked for ways to become legal.</i>

1621
01:44:25,333 --> 01:44:27,750
<i>One day, he got a lawyer.</i>

1622
01:44:28,291 --> 01:44:29,375
<i>Puru Patel.</i>

1623
01:44:30,041 --> 01:44:32,625
Three ways to citizenship...

1624
01:44:33,166 --> 01:44:35,458
Buy, beg, or marry.

1625
01:44:36,708 --> 01:44:37,625
Buy.

1626
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:42,458
Invest a million pounds,
and you'll get residency.

1627
01:44:42,791 --> 01:44:46,000
If we had the money,
why would we <i>dunki?</i>

1628
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:48,791
- Second solution?
- Beg.

1629
01:44:49,083 --> 01:44:51,291
Beg for asylum.

1630
01:44:51,416 --> 01:44:53,666
- What's asylum?
- Refuge.

1631
01:44:54,125 --> 01:44:56,541
England will grant you refuge.

1632
01:44:56,833 --> 01:44:59,083
Refuge from whom?

1633
01:44:59,208 --> 01:45:00,250
From India.

1634
01:45:01,708 --> 01:45:05,333
We'll claim you were activists in India.

1635
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:11,208
At a protest,
your country burned Sukhi alive.

1636
01:45:11,791 --> 01:45:14,541
Say, you'd be killed as well.

1637
01:45:14,958 --> 01:45:17,416
England can't deny asylum.

1638
01:45:17,666 --> 01:45:18,708
Third solution?

1639
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:21,375
What's wrong with the second?

1640
01:45:22,208 --> 01:45:23,916
My country didn't kill Sukhi.

1641
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:25,916
Why lie?

1642
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,583
Your statement won't be on TV.

1643
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,875
It'll stay in a file. Who cares?

1644
01:45:32,375 --> 01:45:35,041
I'm a soldier. I care.

1645
01:45:35,291 --> 01:45:36,708
Then, the third solution. Marry.

1646
01:45:37,458 --> 01:45:41,625
Marry a British passport holder.
Divorce after two years.

1647
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:43,250
If the bride's a no-show?

1648
01:45:43,541 --> 01:45:45,250
- Catherine didn't show up--
- Enough.

1649
01:45:45,333 --> 01:45:46,791
- Balli, let it go.
- Not a bride. A groom!

1650
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:49,291
Hey, baldie!

1651
01:45:51,166 --> 01:45:53,750
He's coming cheap. 5000 pounds.

1652
01:45:53,916 --> 01:45:57,541
A thousand now, rest on divorce.

1653
01:45:57,625 --> 01:46:01,041
Is it legal here? A man marrying a man?

1654
01:46:01,666 --> 01:46:03,083
I'll do it.

1655
01:46:03,458 --> 01:46:06,333
Stop beaming.
He's not for you but for Manu.

1656
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:12,625
No.

1657
01:46:14,541 --> 01:46:15,708
Next solution?

1658
01:46:15,791 --> 01:46:19,708
Manu, once you're legal,

1659
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:23,625
marry the man you love.

1660
01:46:24,041 --> 01:46:29,333
Then both live legally...
happily ever after.

1661
01:46:32,708 --> 01:46:35,500
Forget him.
You won't have to live with him.

1662
01:46:37,833 --> 01:46:39,875
So... shall I book a church?

1663
01:46:50,333 --> 01:46:52,875
Are you prepared,
as you follow the path of marriage,

1664
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:57,208
to love and honor each other
for as long as you both shall live?

1665
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,000
I am.

1666
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:00,666
I am.

1667
01:47:01,541 --> 01:47:06,541
In the name of the Holy Spirit,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1668
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,291
You may now kiss the bride.

1669
01:47:23,875 --> 01:47:26,500
Why not a flying kiss?
Why the mouth?

1670
01:47:27,083 --> 01:47:28,750
I will kill you!

1671
01:47:29,083 --> 01:47:30,291
I will kill you!

1672
01:47:39,208 --> 01:47:41,583
How dare you touch her!

1673
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:43,291
What happened, Manu?

1674
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:46,166
- Kissing me on the mouth.
- On the mouth?!

1675
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:47,166
On the mouth?

1676
01:47:56,791 --> 01:47:58,958
Patel told me to kiss her.

1677
01:47:59,208 --> 01:48:00,250
Hardy, enough!

1678
01:48:01,458 --> 01:48:04,083
Without a kiss, a marriage looks fake.

1679
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:08,250
I didn't say, go honeymooning
and have children.

1680
01:48:08,375 --> 01:48:11,416
It's just a kiss. For evidence!

1681
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:12,500
Why is there a problem?

1682
01:48:12,833 --> 01:48:17,541
As a lawyer, I advised, "Kiss the bride."

1683
01:48:17,833 --> 01:48:18,708
On the mouth?

1684
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:19,750
As a lawyer.

1685
01:48:22,291 --> 01:48:23,541
You pimp!

1686
01:48:23,625 --> 01:48:26,125
It's an English custom.

1687
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:28,500
I agree, it's wrong. But what to do?

1688
01:48:28,625 --> 01:48:30,125
The priest asked them to kiss.

1689
01:48:31,875 --> 01:48:33,416
- On the mouth?
- Ask him.

1690
01:48:34,041 --> 01:48:35,000
Wait right there!

1691
01:48:38,291 --> 01:48:39,416
Stop!

1692
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:41,500
Open the door!

1693
01:48:41,791 --> 01:48:43,916
You said, kiss on the mouth?

1694
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:47,250
You think I will let that junkie
touch Manu?

1695
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:48,750
Hello? Police?

1696
01:48:48,833 --> 01:48:51,208
I'll fix you all!

1697
01:48:54,041 --> 01:48:55,458
I'm her man!

1698
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:09,958
Praise Lord Jesus!

1699
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,958
{\an8}Hello, police.

1700
01:49:20,041 --> 01:49:22,208
{\an8}What a lovely weather today.
You like?

1701
01:49:22,375 --> 01:49:23,375
Shut up!

1702
01:49:24,083 --> 01:49:26,333
Wait! Why arrest me?

1703
01:49:26,541 --> 01:49:29,375
Because we have reason to believe
this is a sham marriage.

1704
01:49:29,583 --> 01:49:32,541
No... love marriage.

1705
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:33,875
I love him.

1706
01:49:35,083 --> 01:49:36,291
How long have you known each other?

1707
01:49:39,666 --> 01:49:41,583
- Five...
- Five years.

1708
01:49:41,916 --> 01:49:42,958
What's his mother's name?

1709
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:45,125
Mummy.

1710
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:48,500
I call her Mummy-ji. Respect.

1711
01:49:48,666 --> 01:49:50,708
- Michelle.
- Michelle Mummy-ji.

1712
01:49:51,333 --> 01:49:52,916
My father's name is Donald.

1713
01:49:53,416 --> 01:49:56,000
Donald Papa-ji. Respect.

1714
01:49:56,458 --> 01:49:58,291
Right. You, come with me.

1715
01:50:02,875 --> 01:50:04,083
What sort of car do you drive?

1716
01:50:04,708 --> 01:50:06,416
I don't have a car.

1717
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:08,958
What color is his car?

1718
01:50:13,041 --> 01:50:14,416
I sit inside car.

1719
01:50:14,541 --> 01:50:16,166
Outside color, how I know?

1720
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:20,666
Come on.

1721
01:50:51,833 --> 01:50:52,750
Sorry.

1722
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,333
I know you're in love but...

1723
01:51:13,541 --> 01:51:17,375
one kiss would've made you legal.

1724
01:51:20,041 --> 01:51:21,708
But what's wrong is wrong.

1725
01:51:21,916 --> 01:51:23,291
What now?

1726
01:51:23,916 --> 01:51:28,458
The marriage didn't work,
so let's use death.

1727
01:51:28,625 --> 01:51:30,208
Okay, deploy death!

1728
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:31,375
Shut up.

1729
01:51:31,458 --> 01:51:32,750
Death?

1730
01:51:32,875 --> 01:51:36,625
I'll bring Sukhi's ashes to the court.

1731
01:51:36,958 --> 01:51:39,875
That'll shock the judge.

1732
01:51:40,333 --> 01:51:43,250
He'll ask, "Are you in danger?
Want asylum?"

1733
01:51:43,541 --> 01:51:45,708
You just have to say yes.

1734
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:49,333
- Will it work?
- A hundred percent!

1735
01:51:49,541 --> 01:51:52,708
But don't wrestle the judge.

1736
01:51:53,875 --> 01:51:55,958
He won't kiss Manu.

1737
01:52:07,541 --> 01:52:10,666
Take this. Stir the judge's soul.

1738
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:12,208
- Move.
- Yes.

1739
01:52:12,333 --> 01:52:13,875
- Move.
- Yes, sir.

1740
01:52:14,208 --> 01:52:16,958
Remember three words.
"I want asylum!"

1741
01:52:18,833 --> 01:52:20,916
Mr. Hardayal Singh Dhillon.

1742
01:52:28,375 --> 01:52:29,583
Please wear the headphones.

1743
01:52:31,125 --> 01:52:32,000
Sure.

1744
01:52:32,833 --> 01:52:34,583
Mr. Dhillon, what is that?

1745
01:52:35,041 --> 01:52:35,916
"What's that?"

1746
01:52:37,375 --> 01:52:40,250
Ashes of my friend Sukhi.

1747
01:52:40,708 --> 01:52:42,916
"Ashes... of my friend Sukhi."

1748
01:52:43,791 --> 01:52:45,583
Are you seeking asylum?

1749
01:52:45,666 --> 01:52:47,708
Is your life under threat
in your country?

1750
01:52:48,041 --> 01:52:49,625
"Is your life under threat
in your country?

1751
01:52:49,916 --> 01:52:51,125
Are you seeking asylum?"

1752
01:52:52,416 --> 01:52:53,291
No, Mr. Judge.

1753
01:52:54,375 --> 01:52:56,208
I'm under no threat in my country.

1754
01:53:00,125 --> 01:53:02,083
So, why have you entered
our country illegally?

1755
01:53:02,958 --> 01:53:04,333
Couldn't get a visa.

1756
01:53:04,875 --> 01:53:06,833
Why don't you grant visas?

1757
01:53:07,958 --> 01:53:11,000
You use German cars and Saudi fuel.

1758
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:14,791
Eat Italian pizza. Sip Sri Lankan tea.

1759
01:53:15,250 --> 01:53:16,791
Wear shirts from India.

1760
01:53:17,375 --> 01:53:19,333
If you allow foreign goods,

1761
01:53:20,625 --> 01:53:22,541
then why stop foreign humans?

1762
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:25,458
We don't stop foreigners
coming into the country.

1763
01:53:25,541 --> 01:53:28,541
We just require them
to follow a valid visa process.

1764
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:33,083
Otherwise, we would be allowing
terrorists or criminals into the country.

1765
01:53:33,291 --> 01:53:35,583
<i>Dunkers</i> don't commit crimes.

1766
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,541
They fear deportation,

1767
01:53:38,875 --> 01:53:41,458
even breathing silently, fearing cops.

1768
01:53:42,041 --> 01:53:43,333
They're not terrorists.

1769
01:53:44,291 --> 01:53:45,541
Terrorists come to kill.

1770
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:47,875
Dunkers come to live.

1771
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:50,500
For two square meals.

1772
01:53:51,208 --> 01:53:54,208
You are only thinking
of your people, Mr. Dhillon.

1773
01:53:54,625 --> 01:53:57,875
There are more than 500,000
illegal immigrants in this country.

1774
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:02,166
Do you have any idea of the number
of jobs that our people have lost?

1775
01:54:03,333 --> 01:54:06,000
I beg to differ. You're wrong.

1776
01:54:07,083 --> 01:54:10,458
Migrants create jobs, not decrease them.

1777
01:54:11,708 --> 01:54:14,791
To feed 500,000,
many eateries are needed here.

1778
01:54:15,541 --> 01:54:18,583
For their clothes,
many tailors are needed.

1779
01:54:18,666 --> 01:54:20,958
So many barbers for haircuts.

1780
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:24,666
Besides, they do jobs you shun.

1781
01:54:25,166 --> 01:54:28,250
Clean your gutters and trash.

1782
01:54:29,666 --> 01:54:32,000
Deport these 500,000,

1783
01:54:33,583 --> 01:54:35,000
and your country will collapse.

1784
01:54:35,458 --> 01:54:38,708
What you seem to be suggesting
is that we should have open borders.

1785
01:54:39,041 --> 01:54:41,666
Your borders were always open.

1786
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:43,708
Invest a million, settle here.

1787
01:54:44,541 --> 01:54:46,208
Borders keep out only the poor.

1788
01:54:46,583 --> 01:54:49,791
The law says
we can only grant asylum

1789
01:54:49,875 --> 01:54:51,750
in the case of war and persecution.

1790
01:54:52,708 --> 01:54:54,916
Not in the case of poverty.

1791
01:54:55,750 --> 01:55:00,875
Death by bullet or death by hunger...
what's the difference?

1792
01:55:01,666 --> 01:55:02,583
A human is dead.

1793
01:55:03,958 --> 01:55:08,625
This is my friend Sukhi.

1794
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:13,166
He wanted a visa for a day
to take Jassi back home.

1795
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:15,833
They ignored his need.

1796
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:18,000
Read him the rule book.

1797
01:55:20,625 --> 01:55:21,500
He died.

1798
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:29,416
He burned before my very eyes...

1799
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:33,666
drenched in kerosene...

1800
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:46,541
During the winter season,
birds migrate from Russia to Punjab...

1801
01:55:47,625 --> 01:55:48,541
without a visa.

1802
01:55:50,416 --> 01:55:52,375
Our birds don't convene a court...

1803
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:56,750
knowing their homes are frozen

1804
01:55:57,125 --> 01:55:58,958
and they'll die there.

1805
01:56:00,083 --> 01:56:02,500
Why can't humans understand this?

1806
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:08,875
People are compelled to leave their homes
due to a pressing necessity.

1807
01:56:09,458 --> 01:56:12,541
No one desires to leave
their family, friends, and country

1808
01:56:13,041 --> 01:56:14,958
only to face bullets at borders.

1809
01:56:21,208 --> 01:56:22,083
Look...

1810
01:56:22,625 --> 01:56:26,583
I can, according to the provision of law,
grant you a stay,

1811
01:56:27,083 --> 01:56:32,333
but only if you say that your life
is under threat in your country.

1812
01:56:36,458 --> 01:56:39,583
A judge who encourages lying in court!

1813
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:42,458
No, Mr. Judge.

1814
01:56:42,791 --> 01:56:44,458
I face no threat in my country.

1815
01:56:45,333 --> 01:56:49,291
It is my motherland.
I won't insult it to live here.

1816
01:56:52,583 --> 01:56:53,541
You're a judge.

1817
01:56:55,625 --> 01:56:57,291
Deliver justice.

1818
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,458
Mr. Dhillon, I derive no pleasure
from what I'm about to say.

1819
01:57:12,583 --> 01:57:13,708
The order of the court

1820
01:57:13,791 --> 01:57:17,208
is that Mr. Hardayal Singh Dhillon
will be deported back to India.

1821
01:57:34,625 --> 01:57:35,500
Long live India!

1822
01:57:36,708 --> 01:57:40,666
Your friend is an extraordinary man,
but if you wish to remain in this country,

1823
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:44,291
I cannot recommend that you follow
the path that he has chosen.

1824
01:57:44,916 --> 01:57:49,208
I now need to speak to Miss Manu Randhawa.

1825
01:57:55,708 --> 01:57:56,666
Come, Manu.

1826
01:57:56,750 --> 01:57:58,125
Let's go back home.

1827
01:57:58,791 --> 01:58:00,708
Where do I have a home?

1828
01:58:02,625 --> 01:58:04,041
I'm here to regain it.

1829
01:58:06,083 --> 01:58:07,208
Miss Randhawa...

1830
01:58:15,333 --> 01:58:16,458
Miss Randhawa.

1831
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:37,500
Miss Randhawa, is your life
under threat in your country?

1832
01:58:42,791 --> 01:58:44,125
Are you seeking asylum?

1833
01:58:48,208 --> 01:58:49,291
Yes, grant me asylum.

1834
01:58:51,166 --> 01:58:52,083
Please.

1835
01:59:39,958 --> 01:59:41,083
Hardy!

1836
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:05,333
I'll miss you terribly.

1837
02:00:08,125 --> 02:00:09,541
Take care of yourself.

1838
02:00:19,958 --> 02:00:25,166
<i>I don't question the reason you're gone</i>

1839
02:00:25,916 --> 02:00:31,166
<i>I don't question the reason you're gone</i>

1840
02:00:31,625 --> 02:00:37,125
<i>But I'll pray for your return every dawn</i>

1841
02:00:37,708 --> 02:00:43,125
<i>I'll pray for your return every dawn</i>

1842
02:00:43,583 --> 02:00:49,291
<i>God may send every trial my way</i>

1843
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:55,125
<i>God may send every trial my way</i>

1844
02:00:55,416 --> 02:01:00,958
<i>But I won't accept your going away</i>

1845
02:01:01,291 --> 02:01:06,916
<i>I won't accept your going away</i>

1846
02:01:07,291 --> 02:01:13,041
<i>My hopeful heart will wait every day</i>

1847
02:01:13,291 --> 02:01:18,958
<i>By the lonely road that took you away</i>

1848
02:01:19,166 --> 02:01:25,000
<i>Till my last breath
Till the doorstep of death</i>

1849
02:01:25,166 --> 02:01:28,083
<i>My hopeful heart will wait every day</i>

1850
02:01:28,166 --> 02:01:30,791
<i>By the lonely road that took you away</i>

1851
02:01:31,041 --> 02:01:36,791
<i>My hopeful heart will wait every day</i>

1852
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:43,208
<i>By the lonely road that took you away</i>

1853
02:01:54,708 --> 02:02:00,291
<i>Eons will pass
I'll pretend they're a minute</i>

1854
02:02:00,708 --> 02:02:06,250
<i>As I wait for a life...
With you back in it</i>

1855
02:02:06,625 --> 02:02:12,166
<i>My eyes may struggle to see me
In the mirror one day</i>

1856
02:02:12,541 --> 02:02:18,250
<i>But they'll still spot you
In a crowd far away</i>

1857
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:24,125
<i>My hopeful heart will wait every day</i>

1858
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:30,166
<i>By the lonely road that took you away</i>

1859
02:02:30,333 --> 02:02:35,916
<i>My hopeful heart will wait every day</i>

1860
02:02:36,250 --> 02:02:41,958
<i>By the lonely road that took you away</i>

1861
02:02:42,166 --> 02:02:48,000
<i>Till my last breath
Till the doorstep of death</i>

1862
02:02:48,166 --> 02:02:53,750
<i>My hopeful heart will wait every day</i>

1863
02:02:53,958 --> 02:02:56,791
<i>By the lonely road that took you away</i>

1864
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,750
<i>My hopeful heart will wait every day</i>

1865
02:02:59,916 --> 02:03:05,333
<i>- By the lonely road that took you away</i>
- Hardy!

1866
02:03:05,458 --> 02:03:06,500
Coach!

1867
02:03:06,625 --> 02:03:08,500
Hardy!

1868
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:20,375
What a lovely weather today!

1869
02:03:21,458 --> 02:03:23,750
Get in here!

1870
02:03:31,875 --> 02:03:35,250
Why not come to India? Why Dubai?

1871
02:03:35,541 --> 02:03:37,541
- Didn't get a visa for India.
- Why?

1872
02:03:37,833 --> 02:03:40,291
As refugees, we couldn't leave England.

1873
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:45,583
- We finally got citizenship last year...
- Okay.

1874
02:03:46,083 --> 02:03:47,833
but the Indian Embassy denied us visas.

1875
02:03:47,916 --> 02:03:49,208
Why?

1876
02:03:49,375 --> 02:03:50,833
They said,

1877
02:03:51,166 --> 02:03:56,041
"For asylum, you claimed
your life's at risk in India...

1878
02:03:56,166 --> 02:03:58,708
- Oh, yes, the asylum issue.
- So, why go back?"

1879
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,541
We're done with London.
Time to go home.

1880
02:04:02,625 --> 02:04:06,916
Where are your families?
Did you marry?

1881
02:04:07,166 --> 02:04:08,291
Tell him.

1882
02:04:08,375 --> 02:04:09,250
- Tell me.
- Coach...

1883
02:04:09,875 --> 02:04:12,166
- I married a German lady.
- Excellent!

1884
02:04:12,250 --> 02:04:14,666
Got divorced due to my height.

1885
02:04:14,875 --> 02:04:16,041
Height?

1886
02:04:16,625 --> 02:04:18,958
She said my height was low.

1887
02:04:19,041 --> 02:04:21,333
Not height, your IQ was low.

1888
02:04:21,458 --> 02:04:25,625
- Yes, something was low.
- Something is definitely low in you.

1889
02:04:25,958 --> 02:04:29,208
- Are you single?
- I'm not.

1890
02:04:29,333 --> 02:04:31,583
- Wow!
- I have my phone and my charger.

1891
02:04:31,708 --> 02:04:33,000
We make a happy trio.

1892
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:39,041
And where's your Jogi?

1893
02:04:39,458 --> 02:04:42,166
- Jogi who?
- Your husband!

1894
02:04:42,875 --> 02:04:44,791
Son of Sukarma and Santokh Jogi.

1895
02:04:45,291 --> 02:04:48,666
Brother of Sonia and Simran Jogi.
Names on your wedding card.

1896
02:04:48,916 --> 02:04:50,333
Where are the Jogis?

1897
02:04:55,416 --> 02:04:56,375
Oh!

1898
02:04:58,458 --> 02:04:59,500
Is he dead?

1899
02:05:03,291 --> 02:05:04,166
No.

1900
02:05:04,291 --> 02:05:06,833
Did the scoundrel dump you?

1901
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:12,625
You! You dumped him?

1902
02:05:15,708 --> 02:05:16,583
No?

1903
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Oh! You never married!

1904
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:24,625
Crazy lady!

1905
02:05:25,625 --> 02:05:27,916
You printed only one card... for me!

1906
02:05:28,083 --> 02:05:30,708
- If I hadn't, would you have married?
- I don't know.

1907
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,916
Otherwise, you'd have waited
for me lifelong.

1908
02:05:33,083 --> 02:05:34,875
I was too attractive to forget.

1909
02:05:36,375 --> 02:05:39,000
How does your wife look?

1910
02:05:39,125 --> 02:05:41,583
- No, let it be. Drop it.
- Can't be hotter than me.

1911
02:05:41,666 --> 02:05:43,208
So... what's the plan?

1912
02:05:43,375 --> 02:05:46,541
<i>Dunki</i> again or any chance of a visa?

1913
02:05:46,958 --> 02:05:48,541
- They're harassing us.
- It will be done.

1914
02:05:48,625 --> 02:05:50,000
It can take six to eight months.

1915
02:05:50,375 --> 02:05:52,791
So, come after six months.

1916
02:05:53,166 --> 02:05:54,458
What's the big rush?

1917
02:05:54,833 --> 02:05:55,791
Are you dying?

1918
02:05:57,375 --> 02:05:58,250
Yes.

1919
02:05:59,833 --> 02:06:00,708
What?

1920
02:06:07,375 --> 02:06:08,958
The doctor has given me a month.

1921
02:06:11,041 --> 02:06:12,500
I fled the hospital.

1922
02:06:19,708 --> 02:06:22,375
- What happened to you?
- A tumor.

1923
02:06:24,583 --> 02:06:25,500
In her brain.

1924
02:06:32,333 --> 02:06:33,208
Stop it.

1925
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:34,958
Leave me alone!

1926
02:06:36,458 --> 02:06:37,375
Let me...

1927
02:06:38,625 --> 02:06:39,500
Coach?

1928
02:06:40,666 --> 02:06:41,583
Wait.

1929
02:06:42,958 --> 02:06:45,375
He's a soldier. He'll cry in solitude.

1930
02:07:09,541 --> 02:07:10,541
Enough now.

1931
02:07:13,625 --> 02:07:18,708
Did my dad put up the nameplate
on the gate?

1932
02:07:19,166 --> 02:07:20,583
"Randhawa House."

1933
02:07:20,958 --> 02:07:21,875
No.

1934
02:07:22,750 --> 02:07:23,916
He's put something else.

1935
02:07:24,958 --> 02:07:27,166
I too put something on your roof.

1936
02:07:28,708 --> 02:07:30,958
- An airplane?
- No.

1937
02:07:32,708 --> 02:07:33,583
What then?

1938
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:37,625
You come and see.

1939
02:07:42,125 --> 02:07:43,083
So, take me home.

1940
02:07:45,666 --> 02:07:49,875
I haven't hugged my parents in 25 years.

1941
02:07:51,791 --> 02:07:54,041
I haven't seen the home I regained.

1942
02:07:55,125 --> 02:07:57,916
- I don't want to die among strangers.
- No...

1943
02:07:58,791 --> 02:08:01,458
I want to die in my country.
Among my family.

1944
02:08:04,041 --> 02:08:05,291
I'll take you home.

1945
02:08:07,041 --> 02:08:09,375
This Diwali will be at home.

1946
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:11,458
<i>Dunki</i> again?

1947
02:08:12,375 --> 02:08:14,791
At your age, old dame?

1948
02:08:15,125 --> 02:08:16,625
I'll take you by airplane.

1949
02:08:20,625 --> 02:08:21,500
I will.

1950
02:08:22,708 --> 02:08:24,250
Without a visa? How?

1951
02:08:26,041 --> 02:08:29,291
- Like this. Soldier's promise!
- Yeah, sure.

1952
02:08:35,166 --> 02:08:36,333
- Hello?
<i>- Hello.</i>

1953
02:08:36,583 --> 02:08:38,333
Hardy! Met Manu?

1954
02:08:38,416 --> 02:08:42,500
Yes. Have to get her back.
Need your help.

1955
02:08:42,625 --> 02:08:43,708
<i>Say it.</i>

1956
02:08:43,791 --> 02:08:45,916
Do you know any <i>dunki</i> agents in Dubai?

1957
02:08:46,708 --> 02:08:47,583
Bakir.

1958
02:08:47,666 --> 02:08:49,083
Is he trustworthy?

1959
02:08:49,625 --> 02:08:53,625
Trustworthy agents don't exist!
Meet him anyway.

1960
02:08:53,708 --> 02:08:56,583
Ship me some stuff.
Sending you a list.

1961
02:08:56,750 --> 02:08:59,000
Hardy, all the best.

1962
02:09:03,625 --> 02:09:06,041
<i>Your destination is 500 meters away.</i>

1963
02:09:09,208 --> 02:09:10,166
<i>Turn right.</i>

1964
02:09:14,208 --> 02:09:15,833
<i>You have reached your destination.</i>

1965
02:09:23,333 --> 02:09:24,208
Hardy?

1966
02:09:26,041 --> 02:09:26,916
Bakir?

1967
02:09:27,333 --> 02:09:28,583
Geetu called.

1968
02:09:29,375 --> 02:09:31,041
What can I do for you?

1969
02:09:31,333 --> 02:09:33,000
Send some people to India.

1970
02:09:33,416 --> 02:09:35,250
- Do they have a visa?
- No.

1971
02:09:35,625 --> 02:09:37,625
- Passport?
- No.

1972
02:09:37,833 --> 02:09:38,750
Money?

1973
02:09:41,166 --> 02:09:42,041
Yes.

1974
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:43,875
Consider it done.

1975
02:09:47,666 --> 02:09:50,958
A container leaves from Jeddah for India.

1976
02:09:51,041 --> 02:09:52,750
It takes five days.

1977
02:09:53,333 --> 02:09:56,416
We land in Bhuj.

1978
02:09:57,125 --> 02:10:00,375
From there, drive to Laltu.

1979
02:10:01,666 --> 02:10:03,291
Check who's at the door.

1980
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:04,375
Mr. Hardy?

1981
02:10:06,541 --> 02:10:08,083
Geetu has sent a parcel!

1982
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,500
What's this?

1983
02:10:11,708 --> 02:10:14,500
Indian clothes.

1984
02:10:15,083 --> 02:10:17,500
With "Made in India" labels.

1985
02:10:18,458 --> 02:10:20,666
Punjabi newspapers.

1986
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:21,833
Pack them.

1987
02:10:22,083 --> 02:10:26,166
Discard your British SIM cards and phones.

1988
02:10:26,916 --> 02:10:29,458
Here are the Indian ones. Hang on to them.

1989
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:31,708
Kutch is a border area.

1990
02:10:31,875 --> 02:10:35,541
If caught, we should appear
Punjabi tourists.

1991
02:10:35,666 --> 02:10:39,625
You had promised a plane ride.

1992
02:10:39,916 --> 02:10:41,958
It's a <i>dunki</i> again!

1993
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:20,166
Give your British passports to Bakir.

1994
02:11:20,291 --> 02:11:22,000
- He'll burn them.
- Why?

1995
02:11:22,083 --> 02:11:25,333
If caught, there should be
no evidence you're British.

1996
02:11:28,083 --> 02:11:30,041
Go! Get inside.

1997
02:11:31,375 --> 02:11:32,333
Get inside.

1998
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:33,541
- Balli.
- Give me your hand.

1999
02:11:33,958 --> 02:11:35,625
Get inside.

2000
02:11:37,541 --> 02:11:38,541
Hurry up.

2001
02:11:40,625 --> 02:11:41,708
Let's go.

2002
02:11:41,791 --> 02:11:43,333
- Pick up the food packets.
- Food is here.

2003
02:11:48,458 --> 02:11:49,833
Pick it up.

2004
02:11:53,958 --> 02:11:55,833
That's a lot of food for four days!

2005
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,125
Four days?

2006
02:11:59,208 --> 02:12:01,083
It'll take you two weeks to London.

2007
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,875
Two weeks for London?

2008
02:12:06,875 --> 02:12:08,291
We're not going to London!

2009
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,083
Big <i>phoo-phoo!</i> Wrong container!

2010
02:12:13,666 --> 02:12:15,375
- Bakir, open the door!
- Hey!

2011
02:12:16,833 --> 02:12:18,000
Let it go.

2012
02:12:19,750 --> 02:12:21,416
- Call Bakir.
- Yes.

2013
02:12:21,750 --> 02:12:23,500
- I will call him.
- Call him.

2014
02:12:28,291 --> 02:12:29,541
He cut the call.

2015
02:12:29,666 --> 02:12:30,583
What?

2016
02:12:30,916 --> 02:12:32,125
What now?

2017
02:12:38,958 --> 02:12:39,916
Omar Abbasi.

2018
02:12:40,250 --> 02:12:42,541
What's the reward
for reporting illegal immigrants?

2019
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:44,875
Where do I come?

2020
02:12:45,416 --> 02:12:46,333
Jeddah Port.

2021
02:12:47,416 --> 02:12:48,291
Okay!

2022
02:12:59,875 --> 02:13:02,541
We're in the wrong container.
Let us out!

2023
02:13:03,291 --> 02:13:04,625
Open it!

2024
02:13:14,458 --> 02:13:16,375
Stop the truck.

2025
02:13:24,250 --> 02:13:25,125
Go fast!

2026
02:13:29,208 --> 02:13:30,291
Open, dammit!

2027
02:13:30,916 --> 02:13:31,833
Driver!

2028
02:13:40,875 --> 02:13:42,250
- What was that?!
- What the hell!

2029
02:14:05,333 --> 02:14:07,291
- This is the container.
- Get it down!

2030
02:14:07,666 --> 02:14:10,791
Offload the container!

2031
02:14:26,166 --> 02:14:27,041
Bakir.

2032
02:14:27,791 --> 02:14:28,666
Oh.

2033
02:14:36,458 --> 02:14:39,291
{\an8}Omar no <i>hamar.</i>

2034
02:14:43,125 --> 02:14:44,333
Bakir... translate.

2035
02:14:44,708 --> 02:14:45,958
<i>Hamar</i> means donkey.

2036
02:14:46,458 --> 02:14:48,625
Omar says he's no donkey.

2037
02:14:49,416 --> 02:14:51,375
Bakir sent me this.

2038
02:14:56,041 --> 02:14:57,083
{\an8}If you lie...

2039
02:14:58,166 --> 02:15:02,458
{\an8}you go to jail for... 50 years.

2040
02:15:02,875 --> 02:15:04,708
Fifty years in prison for lying.

2041
02:15:04,916 --> 02:15:08,583
{\an8}Now, your name and citizenship.

2042
02:15:08,791 --> 02:15:10,500
Your name and citizenship.

2043
02:15:11,541 --> 02:15:14,208
I'm Hardayal Singh Dhillon.

2044
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:16,416
India.

2045
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:20,750
- Tell him.
- Balli Kakkad from England.

2046
02:15:21,208 --> 02:15:23,000
Buggu Lakhanpal. England.

2047
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:25,000
Manu Randhawa. England.

2048
02:15:25,250 --> 02:15:26,583
{\an8}Citizens of England?

2049
02:15:30,125 --> 02:15:32,041
{\an8}You always take a container
to go home?

2050
02:15:32,291 --> 02:15:34,416
No, sir. We were going to India.

2051
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:35,375
Via London?

2052
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:38,000
We got into the wrong container.

2053
02:15:38,125 --> 02:15:39,000
Yes.

2054
02:15:39,291 --> 02:15:40,875
Don't lie, Gulab.

2055
02:15:42,083 --> 02:15:43,833
- The game's over.
- Who's Gulab?

2056
02:15:44,583 --> 02:15:46,375
You are Gulab. Who else?

2057
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:47,583
Come here.

2058
02:15:47,875 --> 02:15:48,875
Promise me...

2059
02:15:48,958 --> 02:15:50,000
- Don't touch me!
- Fine.

2060
02:15:50,166 --> 02:15:51,750
Promise, you'll let me go.

2061
02:15:51,875 --> 02:15:53,041
We are Indians.

2062
02:15:53,208 --> 02:15:54,208
The girl is Chameli.

2063
02:15:54,458 --> 02:15:57,708
{\an8}That guy is Pumpi.
And he's Gulab Singh.

2064
02:15:57,958 --> 02:15:59,125
{\an8}- Thank you.
- Over.

2065
02:15:59,833 --> 02:16:01,416
No, sir. I'm Balli.

2066
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:03,333
- Show your passport.
- Show it.

2067
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:05,750
- I gave it to Bakir.
- When?

2068
02:16:05,958 --> 02:16:08,708
- I'm Balli.
- Shut up!

2069
02:16:09,291 --> 02:16:12,083
Can you prove that he is Gulab?

2070
02:16:12,208 --> 02:16:13,916
I'll do that.

2071
02:16:14,125 --> 02:16:16,250
Give me your phone.

2072
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,500
{\an8}All Indian numbers.

2073
02:16:20,583 --> 02:16:23,041
{\an8}India dial code +91.

2074
02:16:23,125 --> 02:16:25,541
{\an8}Dial any number and check.

2075
02:16:31,375 --> 02:16:32,375
They'll answer.

2076
02:16:35,833 --> 02:16:36,958
Good morning, Gulab.

2077
02:16:37,375 --> 02:16:39,125
- Gulab!
<i>- In the container?</i>

2078
02:16:39,333 --> 02:16:41,833
<i>David will take you
from London to Birmingham.</i>

2079
02:16:42,041 --> 02:16:43,916
Don't worry, be happy.

2080
02:16:45,875 --> 02:16:49,791
I told you... Gulab, Chameli, Pumpi.

2081
02:16:49,875 --> 02:16:51,750
- Are you mad--
- Shut up!

2082
02:16:51,958 --> 02:16:52,833
Shut up.

2083
02:16:54,583 --> 02:16:57,791
Look at them. Do they look British?

2084
02:16:58,083 --> 02:16:59,708
Their clothes...

2085
02:17:00,041 --> 02:17:05,166
Indian clothes...
with "Made in India" labels.

2086
02:17:05,416 --> 02:17:08,375
{\an8}Newspapers... Punjabi.

2087
02:17:08,583 --> 02:17:10,250
{\an8}From last week.

2088
02:17:10,458 --> 02:17:12,750
Check his drawers!

2089
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:15,916
Will any self-respecting Englishman
don them?

2090
02:17:16,166 --> 02:17:19,083
I help you. You help me.

2091
02:17:19,583 --> 02:17:20,666
Let me go.

2092
02:17:21,708 --> 02:17:25,208
{\an8}I told you... Omar no <i>hamar.</i>

2093
02:17:25,291 --> 02:17:27,125
Omar is no donkey.

2094
02:17:27,375 --> 02:17:28,500
I know.

2095
02:17:29,291 --> 02:17:30,250
I'm no donkey, either.

2096
02:17:30,375 --> 02:17:33,041
- Hey!
- Stop!

2097
02:17:33,583 --> 02:17:35,625
- Freeze!
- Stop right there!

2098
02:17:35,750 --> 02:17:37,958
- Stop!
- Hands up.

2099
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:40,041
- Wait.
- Turn around.

2100
02:17:40,333 --> 02:17:41,500
I want to discard this.

2101
02:17:41,708 --> 02:17:42,916
Don't shoot me.

2102
02:17:46,166 --> 02:17:47,041
I'm done.

2103
02:17:47,250 --> 02:17:48,291
I'm a friend.

2104
02:17:49,375 --> 02:17:51,208
{\an8}Leave me.

2105
02:17:52,791 --> 02:17:54,041
I was helping you.

2106
02:17:54,583 --> 02:17:57,125
You had three.
Could've let me go.

2107
02:17:57,791 --> 02:17:58,833
I threw my passport.

2108
02:18:00,625 --> 02:18:03,625
Now prove in court we're Indians.

2109
02:18:05,750 --> 02:18:06,875
We'll be freed someday.

2110
02:18:07,375 --> 02:18:10,041
If not London, we'll settle here.

2111
02:18:10,375 --> 02:18:11,750
You can't do a thing!

2112
02:18:11,916 --> 02:18:14,125
{\an8}- Over!
- I promise you...

2113
02:18:14,541 --> 02:18:17,333
{\an8}I will prove to the court
you are all Indians.

2114
02:18:18,125 --> 02:18:19,916
{\an8}And in two weeks,

2115
02:18:20,416 --> 02:18:23,958
I will put you all
on the flight back to India.

2116
02:18:24,166 --> 02:18:25,625
Omar no <i>hamar!</i>

2117
02:18:27,958 --> 02:18:31,958
Manu, what did he rattle off in English?

2118
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:33,750
Translate.

2119
02:18:33,833 --> 02:18:36,833
He said he'll prove in court...

2120
02:18:39,875 --> 02:18:41,625
- we are Indians.
- Really?

2121
02:18:41,791 --> 02:18:46,250
And in two weeks,
put us all on a flight to India.

2122
02:18:46,375 --> 02:18:50,791
{\an8}<i>Anytime there's a mix-up
He's there for the fix-up</i>

2123
02:18:50,875 --> 02:18:54,958
{\an8}<i>When he makes a resolve
Hurdles dissolve</i>

2124
02:18:55,041 --> 02:18:58,416
<i>He's by your side
When it's high tide</i>

2125
02:18:58,500 --> 02:19:02,458
<i>Make his footprints
Your trusted guide</i>

2126
02:19:02,625 --> 02:19:06,291
<i>What a guy! Never says die!</i>

2127
02:19:06,375 --> 02:19:09,875
<i>Gives all he has
With Punjabi pizzazz</i>

2128
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:13,250
<i>For friends this prince
Gives his life without a wince!</i>

2129
02:19:13,708 --> 02:19:16,083
<i>Hardy's plan was foolproof.</i>

2130
02:19:16,583 --> 02:19:20,750
<i>Our real names would reveal
we're UK citizens.</i>

2131
02:19:21,833 --> 02:19:24,375
<i>Hardy gave us the IDs
of three dead friends,</i>

2132
02:19:25,125 --> 02:19:28,166
{\an8}<i>Gulab, Chameli, and Pumpi...</i>

2133
02:19:28,458 --> 02:19:30,166
{\an8}<i>who were killed in Iran.</i>

2134
02:19:30,625 --> 02:19:32,625
{\an8}<i>On record, they were
still missing persons.</i>

2135
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:35,958
<i>Our files reached Laltu from Saudi.</i>

2136
02:19:36,125 --> 02:19:42,083
<i>Village folk confirmed
three youths Gulab, Chameli, and Pumpi,</i>

2137
02:19:42,250 --> 02:19:44,625
<i>left on a dunki 25 years ago.</i>

2138
02:19:45,416 --> 02:19:46,958
<i>The report stated...</i>

2139
02:19:47,291 --> 02:19:50,458
<i>India would accept them back.</i>

2140
02:19:57,541 --> 02:20:03,250
<i>We must be the first in history
to be so happy in handcuffs.</i>

2141
02:20:10,583 --> 02:20:13,916
I told you I would send you
back to India in two weeks.

2142
02:20:14,375 --> 02:20:15,250
Out!

2143
02:20:28,708 --> 02:20:32,333
{\an8}Omar no <i>hamar.</i> You are...

2144
02:20:32,708 --> 02:20:33,791
"King Donkey."

2145
02:20:39,541 --> 02:20:41,416
{\an8}Why are you all so happy?

2146
02:20:42,333 --> 02:20:43,583
Because we're going home.

2147
02:20:51,083 --> 02:20:52,833
...no <i>hamar!</i>

2148
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:55,458
Sir, what will you have?

2149
02:20:55,791 --> 02:20:59,416
- We're going back home. Some dessert?
- Yes.

2150
02:20:59,541 --> 02:21:01,625
<i>- Gulab jamun?
- Gulab jamun!</i>

2151
02:21:01,708 --> 02:21:03,375
- Perfect!
- Happy Diwali!

2152
02:21:03,541 --> 02:21:05,000
- Bless you!
- Thanks.

2153
02:21:05,666 --> 02:21:12,333
Old dame, I'd promised...
a plane ride back home.

2154
02:21:13,041 --> 02:21:17,083
If you had no wife, I'd kiss you now.

2155
02:21:24,666 --> 02:21:30,958
<i>The very same sky, the very same earth</i>

2156
02:21:34,333 --> 02:21:41,208
<i>Every atom familiar and known</i>

2157
02:21:43,791 --> 02:21:47,250
<i>Despite all wonders</i>

2158
02:21:47,791 --> 02:21:51,625
<i>The world has shown</i>

2159
02:21:53,833 --> 02:21:57,500
{\an8}<i>There's no place like</i>

2160
02:21:58,333 --> 02:22:02,000
<i>The land of my birth</i>

2161
02:22:13,916 --> 02:22:18,083
<i>I come from a faraway land</i>

2162
02:22:18,583 --> 02:22:22,500
<i>The hourglass running out of sand</i>

2163
02:22:23,333 --> 02:22:27,666
<i>But I promise it's true</i>

2164
02:22:27,958 --> 02:22:30,875
<i>I'm still one of you</i>

2165
02:22:30,958 --> 02:22:31,958
Come on!

2166
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:36,875
<i>Wandering like forsaken kites</i>

2167
02:22:37,083 --> 02:22:41,375
<i>All those endless days and nights</i>

2168
02:22:41,708 --> 02:22:46,125
<i>On foreign winds we have flown</i>

2169
02:22:46,208 --> 02:22:50,208
<i>But never ceased to be your own</i>

2170
02:22:51,083 --> 02:22:55,666
<i>- I promise it is true</i>
- Clap. She's a wrestler from London. Come.

2171
02:22:55,750 --> 02:23:00,083
<i>I'm still one of you</i>

2172
02:23:18,750 --> 02:23:19,666
Buggu?

2173
02:23:44,791 --> 02:23:48,833
<i>The same old town</i>

2174
02:23:49,583 --> 02:23:53,833
<i>Beloved places
Smiles of those familiar faces</i>

2175
02:23:54,125 --> 02:23:59,125
<i>Joys that left eternal traces</i>

2176
02:24:03,125 --> 02:24:07,583
<i>Each alley and beloved street</i>

2177
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:12,458
<i>Like old friends I longed to meet</i>

2178
02:24:12,708 --> 02:24:17,875
<i>Where are the days I yearn to repeat?</i>

2179
02:24:21,750 --> 02:24:26,125
<i>The tea stall in the old bazaar</i>

2180
02:24:26,458 --> 02:24:30,666
<i>Silly banter under the stars</i>

2181
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:35,416
<i>The voices of my friends so dear</i>

2182
02:24:35,541 --> 02:24:40,625
<i>The days and nights spent here</i>

2183
02:24:46,041 --> 02:24:50,500
<i>I feel a grief unbearably deep</i>

2184
02:24:50,791 --> 02:24:54,958
<i>For all I lost and could not keep</i>

2185
02:24:55,250 --> 02:24:59,833
<i>I kept hidden in my heart</i>

2186
02:24:59,958 --> 02:25:03,958
<i>The pain of being apart</i>

2187
02:25:04,041 --> 02:25:04,916
{\an8}MANU'S BUNGALOW

2188
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:08,791
{\an8}<i>But I promise it's true</i>

2189
02:25:09,208 --> 02:25:14,166
<i>I'm still one of you</i>

2190
02:25:21,708 --> 02:25:27,083
<i>A long time ago we left our home</i>

2191
02:25:31,083 --> 02:25:35,958
<i>But home never left our hearts</i>

2192
02:25:40,250 --> 02:25:44,625
<i>Home dwells in every heartbeat</i>

2193
02:25:45,041 --> 02:25:50,250
<i>Till the last breath departs</i>

2194
02:25:54,208 --> 02:25:58,750
<i>Some tasks fulfilled
Some unfinished stay</i>

2195
02:25:58,875 --> 02:26:03,916
<i>Now all that remains
At the end of the day</i>

2196
02:26:04,458 --> 02:26:08,791
<i>Is to rest forever on this earth</i>

2197
02:26:09,250 --> 02:26:13,083
<i>The beloved land of my birth</i>

2198
02:26:13,625 --> 02:26:18,291
<i>To rest forever on this earth</i>

2199
02:26:18,708 --> 02:26:23,500
<i>The beloved land of my birth</i>

2200
02:26:24,458 --> 02:26:27,625
You made everyone's life.

2201
02:26:28,916 --> 02:26:30,500
Except yours and mine.

2202
02:26:30,583 --> 02:26:32,375
No, no.

2203
02:26:32,750 --> 02:26:37,750
Like someone said,
it's not over till it is over.

2204
02:26:39,250 --> 02:26:40,500
Speaking English!

2205
02:26:40,666 --> 02:26:43,791
People learn English to go to London.

2206
02:26:44,166 --> 02:26:46,500
I learned after coming back!

2207
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
- Why?
- Because I knew...

2208
02:26:49,708 --> 02:26:53,708
one day, you'd return...
show off your English.

2209
02:26:53,958 --> 02:26:55,708
What would I do? Gape at you?

2210
02:26:56,166 --> 02:26:57,041
Never!

2211
02:26:57,291 --> 02:26:59,041
I'd show off as well!

2212
02:26:59,250 --> 02:27:00,375
- Really?
- Yes.

2213
02:27:00,666 --> 02:27:02,333
- So show off!
- Should I?

2214
02:27:03,083 --> 02:27:04,375
Wait.

2215
02:27:08,125 --> 02:27:11,791
- So, Mr. Hardayal Singh Dhillon...
- Yes?

2216
02:27:11,958 --> 02:27:15,458
Tell me something about your family
in two minutes.

2217
02:27:17,958 --> 02:27:21,166
Two-minute speaking test? Okay.

2218
02:27:22,791 --> 02:27:24,166
My mother dead. My father dead.

2219
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:26,000
My father's mother is dead.
Her mother is dead.

2220
02:27:26,083 --> 02:27:27,333
My aunt dead. Her aunt is dead.

2221
02:27:27,416 --> 02:27:31,708
My uncle dead. Uncle's uncle is dead.

2222
02:27:31,791 --> 02:27:34,166
All... dead, dead, dead!

2223
02:27:36,250 --> 02:27:38,166
I... all alone.

2224
02:27:41,791 --> 02:27:44,750
Now, I need a wife.

2225
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,333
You have a wife. Mrs. Dhillon!

2226
02:27:47,458 --> 02:27:51,333
There's no Mrs. Dhillon
like there's no Mr. Jogi.

2227
02:27:54,125 --> 02:27:55,750
I not married, Manu.

2228
02:27:57,208 --> 02:27:58,333
You didn't marry?

2229
02:27:58,875 --> 02:28:01,625
I wait for you.
I not go to Pathankot.

2230
02:28:01,958 --> 02:28:04,541
Because if Manu wants to find Hardy...

2231
02:28:04,750 --> 02:28:08,416
it should be "pieces of cake."

2232
02:28:10,125 --> 02:28:11,583
Are you for real?

2233
02:28:13,708 --> 02:28:15,958
Came to return a tape recorder...

2234
02:28:16,750 --> 02:28:18,625
stayed back 25 years.

2235
02:28:19,416 --> 02:28:20,833
Ms. Manu Randhawa,

2236
02:28:22,291 --> 02:28:24,708
may I ask for your hand, please?

2237
02:28:26,791 --> 02:28:27,916
Don't think so much.

2238
02:28:28,250 --> 02:28:31,625
You don't have much time.
And my old knee hurts.

2239
02:28:33,333 --> 02:28:37,750
Manu, everyone says
<i>dunki</i> is that journey

2240
02:28:38,291 --> 02:28:41,708
where you face hunger, bullets,
cross borders, and risk life.

2241
02:28:42,583 --> 02:28:45,291
But for me,
that journey wasn't the <i>dunki.</i>

2242
02:28:45,708 --> 02:28:48,458
It was... life.

2243
02:28:49,666 --> 02:28:51,083
Because you were with me.

2244
02:28:52,541 --> 02:28:57,458
My <i>dunki</i> was the 25 years
I spent without you.

2245
02:28:58,916 --> 02:29:04,333
You taught me the true meaning of <i>dunki</i>
is to live far from loved ones.

2246
02:29:08,958 --> 02:29:11,750
Now, please end my <i>dunki,</i> Manu.

2247
02:29:18,250 --> 02:29:21,166
Will you marry Hardy Singh?

2248
02:29:27,875 --> 02:29:34,208
If a man proposes so romantically...
can a lady refuse?

2249
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:37,833
- I will.
- Oh, man!

2250
02:29:39,250 --> 02:29:40,208
Just a minute.

2251
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
One last thing... don't move.

2252
02:29:43,875 --> 02:29:45,625
Just a minute.

2253
02:30:24,875 --> 02:30:31,625
<i>A sentence in your story</i>

2254
02:30:32,666 --> 02:30:37,125
<i>Is all I ask to be</i>

2255
02:30:38,041 --> 02:30:44,958
<i>In your quiet moments</i>

2256
02:30:46,333 --> 02:30:52,125
<i>Spare a thought for me</i>

2257
02:30:53,166 --> 02:30:59,583
<i>No destination left for me now</i>

2258
02:31:00,416 --> 02:31:04,916
<i>My friend</i>

2259
02:31:05,708 --> 02:31:12,625
<i>The refuge of your arms</i>

2260
02:31:13,541 --> 02:31:18,375
<i>Is my journey's end</i>

2261
02:32:44,541 --> 02:32:45,416
{\an8}Coach...

2262
02:32:46,541 --> 02:32:50,708
{\an8}would a jeans store
be successful in Punjab?

2263
02:32:51,333 --> 02:32:53,000
{\an8}Distressed jeans.

2264
02:32:53,208 --> 02:32:55,666
{\an8}Well, your first customer is ready.

2265
02:32:55,875 --> 02:32:56,875
{\an8}His mummy.

2266
02:32:58,875 --> 02:33:01,125
{\an8}Not funny. What is this?

2267
02:33:02,541 --> 02:33:05,875
{\an8}I think we should set up
a fast-food joint. It will thrive.

2268
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,041
- Online.
- Home delivery.

2269
02:33:08,250 --> 02:33:09,166
Wait up!

2270
02:33:11,625 --> 02:33:12,541
Can I say something?

2271
02:33:12,833 --> 02:33:16,041
There's no future in India.
All of you should go to London.

2272
02:33:18,958 --> 02:33:21,041
Who will give us a visa?

2273
02:33:21,916 --> 02:33:23,041
Leave that to me.

2274
02:33:23,916 --> 02:33:24,916
Do you have a college degree?

2275
02:33:26,250 --> 02:33:27,208
No.

2276
02:33:27,333 --> 02:33:28,291
Property?

2277
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:29,916
No.

2278
02:33:30,208 --> 02:33:31,833
A good bank balance?

2279
02:33:32,416 --> 02:33:33,541
No.

2280
02:33:35,625 --> 02:33:36,625
No problem.

2281
02:33:36,875 --> 02:33:38,916
I'll send you on a <i>dunki.</i>

2282
02:33:39,125 --> 02:33:40,541
Oh!

2283
02:33:40,875 --> 02:33:42,083
It's really easy.

2284
02:33:43,125 --> 02:33:45,791
- He says <i>dunki</i> is really easy!
- Sure.

2285
02:33:46,291 --> 02:33:47,958
- Son, place your hand here.
- Over here.

2286
02:33:48,041 --> 02:33:48,958
- Keep it.
- Yes, here.

2287
02:33:49,041 --> 02:33:50,125
- Here?
- Right here.

2288
02:33:50,333 --> 02:33:52,083
Don't worry.
Son, are you okay?

2289
02:33:52,208 --> 02:33:53,833
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Okay.

2290
02:33:54,333 --> 02:33:57,125
You're saying <i>dunki</i> is really easy?!
