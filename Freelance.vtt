WEBVTT

00:01:03.706 --> 00:01:05.417
Do you know
that feeling when you're doing

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:07.388
exactly what you were
put on the Earth to do?

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:10.852
The one where it's like
everything inside you

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:13.544
is moving together in
harmony with the universe?

00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:20.332
Get
off! Get off! Get off!

00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:24.369
Get off! Get off! Get off!

00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:25.872
Get in formation!

00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:27.531
Man, voice-over: No
matter what happens...

00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:29.221
What the fuck took
you so long, private?

00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:30.251
Man, voice-over:
everything will be OK.

00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:32.125
Do not fuck it up
on me, private!

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.813
Sweet fucking baby Jesus!

00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:34.981
Man, voice-over: Yeah.

00:01:34.983 --> 00:01:36.422
Me neither...

00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:40.229
but, you know, one
can hope, right?

00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:42.454
It started when I was a kid.

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:44.124
I always needed to help people.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.324
Hey! Leave him alone!

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:47.827
Or at least I wanted to...

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.125
Unh!

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.964
So I did what any normal,
red-blooded American would do.

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:58.437
To our top summer associate.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.472
Man, voice-over:
I became a lawyer.

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:02.441
That seemed like a safe move.

00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:04.409
You're welcome here at this firm

00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:05.945
anytime you want.

00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:08.380
You're one of us now, all right?
- Yeah!

00:02:08.382 --> 00:02:10.417
Man, voice-over: But
then, I saw it...

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.253
a life of backyard
grilling and play dates,

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:16.656
home improvement projects

00:02:16.658 --> 00:02:18.958
and over planned
tourist adventures,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.293
neighbors I probably
didn't want to know,

00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:24.429
a wife I probably didn't
want to know either,

00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:26.465
maybe an affair
with my neighbor.

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:28.801
The thing was whenever
I saw people like that,

00:02:28.803 --> 00:02:32.404
I always thought, "When did
you decide to stop trying?"

00:02:32.406 --> 00:02:34.308
So I folded that hand.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.547
Yeah. A year of law school
left, 6 figures waiting,

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.684
and I enlist in
the fucking army?

00:02:47.622 --> 00:02:49.488
I mean, what the actual fuck?

00:02:51.826 --> 00:02:53.592
Everyone thought I was insane.

00:02:53.594 --> 00:02:55.527
1, 2, 3!

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.330
I thought I was insane.

00:02:58.332 --> 00:03:00.700
The next thing I knew,

00:03:00.702 --> 00:03:04.304
I made it through the Q Course
with Special Forces selection.

00:03:08.198 --> 00:03:09.732
One minute!

00:03:09.757 --> 00:03:10.857
Man, voice-over: And
for the first time

00:03:10.881 --> 00:03:11.858
in my entire life...

00:03:11.883 --> 00:03:13.396
Let's go surprise some assholes!

00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:15.217
I was happy.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.950
Whoo! Let's do this!

00:03:17.952 --> 00:03:19.453
Saddle up!

00:03:22.657 --> 00:03:24.356
Whoo!

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:31.697
I'd found something worth doing

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.331
in a world where
things worth doing

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:35.333
they didn't come
around very often.

00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:36.936
<b>I found myself...</b>

00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:40.039
Aah!

00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:41.575
I found love...

00:03:46.707 --> 00:03:47.806
Push! Push!

00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.298
I found family...

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:54.654
Come on! Let's go!

00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:56.454
Man, voice-over:
and most of all,

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:58.026
I found purpose.

00:04:00.527 --> 00:04:04.462
That's our
target. President Venegas.

00:04:04.464 --> 00:04:06.333
We're here to take him out.

00:04:09.037 --> 00:04:10.939
See you on the ground!

00:04:20.414 --> 00:04:21.681
Huh?

00:04:21.683 --> 00:04:24.083
No! Shit! Ohh!

00:04:24.085 --> 00:04:27.854
Whoa! Ohh! Huh!

00:04:27.856 --> 00:04:29.722
Ohh!

00:04:29.724 --> 00:04:31.157
Unh!

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.160
Oh, fuck! Aw, shit!

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:36.428
Huh!

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.732
No! Ohh! Unh!

00:04:39.734 --> 00:04:41.033
Huh!

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.675
Guys. Ugh.

00:04:49.677 --> 00:04:51.611
Man, voice-over:
And just like that,

00:04:51.613 --> 00:04:53.395
my purpose was gone.

00:04:56.618 --> 00:04:59.919
I went back to the normal
life that I tried to avoid

00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:02.389
and couldn't feel
more like a failure.

00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:22.434
Mason!

00:05:23.443 --> 00:05:25.211
Mason!

00:05:25.213 --> 00:05:27.682
Casey's gonna be
late for school!

00:05:36.624 --> 00:05:38.925
Good morning.

00:05:38.927 --> 00:05:40.387
Hey! Hey!

00:05:40.412 --> 00:05:41.473
Mm-what?!

00:05:41.498 --> 00:05:44.599
Ew! Your breath smells, Daddy.

00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:48.036
Ohh. Got to brush my teeth.

00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:54.417
OK. You want to drive? No!

00:05:54.442 --> 00:05:56.642
OK. Yeah. In a few years,
it's all yours, though.

00:05:56.644 --> 00:05:57.685
All right? You
in? Everything...

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:59.645
Mason, don't forget
her seat belt.

00:05:59.647 --> 00:06:02.302
Make sure to buckle
your seat belt.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.651
Please.

00:06:04.917 --> 00:06:06.851
Wave to Mommy because
she'll hate me

00:06:06.876 --> 00:06:08.777
even more than she
already does if you don't.

00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:15.560
You know, how's school going?

00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:16.996
There's a boy named Chase

00:06:16.998 --> 00:06:19.065
that bothers me all the time.

00:06:19.067 --> 00:06:21.200
He tries to kiss me and stuff.

00:06:21.202 --> 00:06:23.501
Boy tries to kiss
you? You're 9.

00:06:23.503 --> 00:06:25.905
I'm 8, Daddy. That
makes it even worse.

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:27.206
Tell you what. The next
time he tries to kiss you,

00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:28.583
you hit him in the throat.

00:06:28.608 --> 00:06:29.773
You know what the throat is?

00:06:29.798 --> 00:06:31.164
I'm not an idiot.

00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:32.945
Just hit him in
the Adam's apple.

00:06:32.947 --> 00:06:34.075
All boys have them.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.799
Like penises?

00:06:35.824 --> 00:06:38.191
Uh, yes. Kind... yes.

00:06:38.216 --> 00:06:40.219
Um, just... just hit
him right here, OK?

00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:42.021
It'll make it so he can't
breathe for a little bit.

00:06:42.023 --> 00:06:44.623
Like hitting him in the penis.

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:47.559
Yes, and you know what?
You can do that, also.

00:06:47.561 --> 00:06:49.662
All right? OK. We're here.

00:06:49.664 --> 00:06:51.697
Remember your backpack.

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.867
Go forth, wreak havoc, and
don't forget your book bag.

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:56.168
Bye, Daddy.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.204
You have a great day, OK?

00:06:58.206 --> 00:06:59.974
Learn things.

00:07:09.549 --> 00:07:11.048
So I told them...

00:07:12.345 --> 00:07:13.953
they can't charge
me those calls.

00:07:13.955 --> 00:07:15.755
I... I... I didn't
make those calls.

00:07:15.757 --> 00:07:18.224
I... I... I don't even
know any of those numbers.

00:07:18.226 --> 00:07:20.094
They won't leave me alone, man.

00:07:24.032 --> 00:07:27.066
So, um... so you
want to hire me

00:07:27.068 --> 00:07:30.836
to... argue with your
phone company for you?

00:07:30.838 --> 00:07:32.774
Just my old phone company.

00:07:34.642 --> 00:07:36.611
Scott, uh...

00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:42.148
you... you have my word I
will make this all go away.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.618
Oh! Thank you.
Thank... thank you.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.654
Thank you. Can I
give you a retainer?

00:07:48.656 --> 00:07:51.924
I'd feel better with a
retainer, maybe just 500.

00:07:51.926 --> 00:07:53.225
Like your style, Scott.

00:07:53.227 --> 00:07:54.894
Ha! Oh, my gosh.

00:07:54.896 --> 00:07:56.540
Thank you.

00:07:56.998 --> 00:07:58.664
This... There you go.

00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:00.366
This looks great. I'll...

00:08:00.368 --> 00:08:02.268
Oh, my gosh. I'll
be in touch, OK?

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.005
OK. Thank you.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.874
OK.

00:08:37.038 --> 00:08:39.207
You don't write, you don't call.

00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:42.408
As I live and breathe.

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.276
Sebastian Earle. Hey!

00:08:44.278 --> 00:08:47.346
Aw, man. Look at you.

00:08:47.348 --> 00:08:50.049
God. What are you doing here?

00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:51.383
How'd they get you in a suit?

00:08:51.385 --> 00:08:53.085
I could ask you the same thing.

00:08:53.087 --> 00:08:55.154
Are you kidding?
I'm about to take on

00:08:55.156 --> 00:08:56.755
a global communications
conglomerate,

00:08:56.757 --> 00:08:59.391
so I got to look the part.

00:08:59.393 --> 00:09:01.861
I seem to recall you
saying that quitting law

00:09:01.863 --> 00:09:03.729
was the best decision
you ever made.

00:09:03.731 --> 00:09:05.231
I did. And that
becoming a lawyer

00:09:05.233 --> 00:09:07.867
would only crush your soul.

00:09:07.869 --> 00:09:10.236
Yeah, it has, but I
got a wife and a kid,

00:09:10.238 --> 00:09:12.404
and they both
require income, so...

00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:15.774
in lieu of that, I generate
broken dreams for all involved.

00:09:15.776 --> 00:09:18.110
Well, do you have a half-hour
to spare for an old friend?

00:09:18.112 --> 00:09:20.713
I want to show you something.

00:09:20.715 --> 00:09:22.183
I think Lady Justice can wait.

00:09:52.914 --> 00:09:55.881
So what do you think?

00:09:55.883 --> 00:09:57.116
I think you need a lawyer.

00:09:57.118 --> 00:09:59.818
You know a good one? Nope.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.253
Carry on, fellas.

00:10:01.255 --> 00:10:03.791
Yes, sir. Hey.

00:10:09.764 --> 00:10:14.066
CDI. Heh heh. Chicks Dig It.

00:10:14.068 --> 00:10:17.303
Actually, Contracted
Defense Initiatives,

00:10:17.305 --> 00:10:20.072
but... but, yes, they do.

00:10:20.074 --> 00:10:22.107
You name it, we got it,

00:10:22.109 --> 00:10:24.410
and if we don't, we'll find
it, buy it, or build it.

00:10:24.412 --> 00:10:26.245
We can operate in
any environment

00:10:26.247 --> 00:10:27.980
and any operational condition.

00:10:29.217 --> 00:10:30.883
We are a one-stop
shop and shoot.

00:10:30.885 --> 00:10:34.286
Ranges, mock villages,
our own airstrip,

00:10:34.288 --> 00:10:36.088
the whole kit.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.791
I opened up 7 years
ago. Yeah, I remember,

00:10:38.793 --> 00:10:41.093
but honestly, I never
thought you'd pull it off.

00:10:41.095 --> 00:10:43.229
Hey. Good on you, brother.

00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:45.130
Well, I started with
the U.S. government,

00:10:45.132 --> 00:10:47.132
then moved to Europe, then Asia,

00:10:47.134 --> 00:10:49.001
then South America.

00:10:49.003 --> 00:10:51.303
Now we're over 80%
corporate contracts.

00:10:51.305 --> 00:10:53.906
We're grossing high
8 figures this year.

00:10:53.908 --> 00:10:58.143
Heh. Ahh. Private security work's
always been a bit dicey for me.

00:10:58.145 --> 00:11:00.346
It's, like, a thin line
between mercenary work, yeah?

00:11:00.348 --> 00:11:03.082
Naw. Come on. It's
like any business.

00:11:03.084 --> 00:11:04.516
We sell a product.

00:11:04.518 --> 00:11:07.119
That product is security.

00:11:07.121 --> 00:11:09.388
Cavemen out there,
they're your product?

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.323
They look the part, and
they keep the peace.

00:11:11.325 --> 00:11:13.192
Can't hire fast enough.

00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:16.328
Tons of ex-military,
a few cops... heh...

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.930
and some good, old
boys with a passion

00:11:17.932 --> 00:11:19.431
for the Second Amendment.

00:11:19.433 --> 00:11:20.899
And steroids.

00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:22.401
Don't ask, don't tell. Yeah.

00:11:22.403 --> 00:11:25.104
These guys are, uh, potentially

00:11:25.106 --> 00:11:28.407
your new colleagues.

00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:30.542
No. No.

00:11:30.544 --> 00:11:32.544
No!

00:11:32.546 --> 00:11:34.980
No, no, and no.

00:11:34.982 --> 00:11:36.415
Come on.

00:11:36.417 --> 00:11:38.384
I'm too broken down,
I'm... I'm out of shape.

00:11:38.386 --> 00:11:40.185
I'm too old to go running
around the world, Seb.

00:11:40.187 --> 00:11:41.954
I got a life here.

00:11:41.956 --> 00:11:45.057
Mason, I know you.
You're... you're miserable.

00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:46.425
That's not the point.

00:11:46.427 --> 00:11:48.193
Look. The truth
is broken or not

00:11:48.195 --> 00:11:50.296
you still look the part.

00:11:50.298 --> 00:11:52.197
I'm asking as a personal favor.

00:11:52.199 --> 00:11:54.900
I've got an easy personal
protection detail.

00:11:54.902 --> 00:11:57.303
It's a one-off. Just
help me out, huh?

00:11:57.305 --> 00:11:59.071
Total milk run.

00:11:59.073 --> 00:12:01.440
You guys don't
look like milkmen.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.423
¡Viva Paldoñia!

00:12:17.425 --> 00:12:20.392
¡Viva Paldoñia!

00:12:22.363 --> 00:12:24.196
Everybody is
welcome to Paldoñia.

00:12:24.198 --> 00:12:27.132
It's a beautiful
country, beautiful.

00:12:27.134 --> 00:12:29.203
Juan Arturo Venegas.

00:12:30.905 --> 00:12:32.239
You kidding me?

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.346
You took a job for the guy
that killed half our team?

00:12:40.348 --> 00:12:43.582
We were there to kill
him in the first place.

00:12:43.584 --> 00:12:46.418
Dude, chill. The job
isn't for Venegas.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.421
It's body work for a journalist
who's gonna interview him.

00:12:49.423 --> 00:12:51.290
Just show up, be some
window dressing for her,

00:12:51.292 --> 00:12:53.158
make sure she
doesn't get groped.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.229
A bunch of our friends
died because of that guy.

00:12:58.966 --> 00:13:00.399
You don't have to tell me.

00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:02.534
I know, and look.

00:13:02.536 --> 00:13:04.570
If he were to get hit by a bus,

00:13:04.572 --> 00:13:06.673
I don't think anybody would
be too upset about it.

00:13:06.675 --> 00:13:08.474
Believe me, I'd love
to do it myself,

00:13:08.476 --> 00:13:10.509
but I'm running a business,

00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:12.511
and right now, that business
is getting a journalist

00:13:12.513 --> 00:13:14.179
in and out of Paldoñia.

00:13:14.181 --> 00:13:16.215
Yeah. Send one of
your other guys.

00:13:16.217 --> 00:13:19.151
Heh. I can't spare
them for this.

00:13:19.153 --> 00:13:20.986
Listen. I'm trying
to break into

00:13:20.988 --> 00:13:22.921
the personal protection
racket for journalists,

00:13:22.923 --> 00:13:24.590
and this is the first
step, so I'm overpaying.

00:13:24.592 --> 00:13:27.459
This is me trying
to hook you up, OK?

00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:29.995
No drama. Venegas
is sending a plane

00:13:29.997 --> 00:13:33.031
to D.C. tomorrow to
pick you guys up.

00:13:33.033 --> 00:13:34.535
I'm not interested.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.470
20 grand says you are.

00:13:40.074 --> 00:13:41.407
Who's the journalist?

00:13:41.409 --> 00:13:43.208
This year's recipient

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.244
of the International
Journalism and Editors Award

00:13:45.246 --> 00:13:47.146
Claire Wellington.

00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:52.420
Thank you.

00:13:56.957 --> 00:13:59.291
Journalism at its best,

00:13:59.293 --> 00:14:00.959
it's about the truth.

00:14:00.961 --> 00:14:02.227
I share this with
all the journalists

00:14:02.229 --> 00:14:03.996
who report the facts

00:14:03.998 --> 00:14:07.032
and who value the
truth above all.

00:14:11.305 --> 00:14:14.206
In my haste to
break a major story,

00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:18.177
I neglected... to
perform my due diligence

00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:20.512
in properly fact checking

00:14:20.514 --> 00:14:22.448
and thoroughly
vetting my sources.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.983
I have resigned
my position here.

00:14:28.456 --> 00:14:31.292
Make sure that she
knows what she did was wrong.

00:14:40.702 --> 00:14:44.639
So, uh, how's everybody doing?

00:14:49.778 --> 00:14:51.243
You told your
daughter to hit a boy

00:14:51.245 --> 00:14:52.612
in the throat, and
that boy's father

00:14:52.614 --> 00:14:53.746
is a lawyer. Um...

00:14:53.748 --> 00:14:55.684
A real lawyer.

00:14:59.119 --> 00:15:01.654
Uh, whatever this is,
it's gone, it's done.

00:15:01.656 --> 00:15:03.222
I can't do it anymore, Mason.

00:15:03.224 --> 00:15:05.157
I can't... Jenny,
don't overreact.

00:15:05.159 --> 00:15:07.092
I'm not overreacting. I
think it might be best

00:15:07.094 --> 00:15:08.996
for everybody if
you did move out.

00:15:13.802 --> 00:15:16.034
Never mind. I'll get Casey,
and I'll go to my mom's.

00:15:16.036 --> 00:15:18.472
No. I'll go.

00:15:25.714 --> 00:15:27.448
Hey, Daddy.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.486
What are you doing?

00:15:34.488 --> 00:15:37.155
Building a cruise ship.

00:15:37.157 --> 00:15:41.527
Cruise ship. Wow. That's a
good gig if you can get it.

00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:46.164
Ahh. Listen. I got to go
out of town for a few days.

00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:49.067
It's for work.

00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:52.070
Do they have snow globes
where you're going?

00:15:52.072 --> 00:15:53.706
Tell you what. If they
do, I'll get you one.

00:15:53.708 --> 00:15:55.507
Thanks, Daddy.

00:16:03.317 --> 00:16:05.718
What do you mean you're
going out of town for a few days?

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.252
I took a job. What?

00:16:07.254 --> 00:16:08.621
Yeah. Sebastian
Earle hooked me up.

00:16:08.623 --> 00:16:10.556
What about your practice? Ha!

00:16:10.558 --> 00:16:13.091
You just said a minute ago
that I wasn't a real lawyer.

00:16:13.093 --> 00:16:15.294
What job is this?

00:16:15.296 --> 00:16:17.596
It's private
security. Easy stuff.

00:16:17.598 --> 00:16:19.131
Mason, no.

00:16:19.133 --> 00:16:20.733
That part of your life is over.

00:16:20.735 --> 00:16:22.769
You're not gonna go
and get yourself killed

00:16:22.771 --> 00:16:24.536
and leave our daughter
without a father to raise her.

00:16:24.538 --> 00:16:26.639
Just let me make this money, OK?

00:16:26.641 --> 00:16:28.273
You think I don't know
how unhappy you are

00:16:28.275 --> 00:16:31.209
being just a husband
and a father?

00:16:31.211 --> 00:16:33.245
Imagine what it
feels like to be me,

00:16:33.247 --> 00:16:35.882
knowing that I'm the
life you settled for.

00:16:35.884 --> 00:16:37.482
Jenny, I...

00:16:37.484 --> 00:16:40.753
On second thought,
actually, you should go.

00:16:40.755 --> 00:16:42.588
Maybe that's what you need

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.325
to fix yourself.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.483
Politics in the workplace

00:17:11.485 --> 00:17:13.755
and... and the fallout
from that, please.

00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:17.824
No. It's great. Of course you're
being a weasel about this.

00:17:17.826 --> 00:17:20.627
I can't say I'm surprised.

00:17:20.629 --> 00:17:23.328
Yeah. I wouldn't want to
tarnish your perfect reputation.

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:24.864
You're a saint.
We both know it.

00:17:24.866 --> 00:17:26.333
Excuse me. Claire Wellington?

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.236
Well, please do,
and I'll be sure

00:17:31.238 --> 00:17:33.773
to badmouth you to
anyone who will listen.

00:17:33.775 --> 00:17:37.944
Hey. That's great. Yeah.
Same to you, asshole.

00:17:37.946 --> 00:17:40.178
Miss Wellington...

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.514
I'm... I'm, uh...
I'm from CDI.

00:17:42.516 --> 00:17:45.918
I'm Mason Pettits.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.689
You're late. Where's the car?

00:17:49.691 --> 00:17:51.356
It's, uh, this way.

00:17:51.358 --> 00:17:53.193
Great. Can you
help me with this?

00:17:58.232 --> 00:18:00.232
So you're my Green Beret.

00:18:00.234 --> 00:18:02.467
Army Special Forces.

00:18:02.469 --> 00:18:04.904
Right. A Green Beret is a hat.

00:18:04.906 --> 00:18:08.306
Delta Force isn't the name
of anything but a bad movie.

00:18:08.308 --> 00:18:10.810
I've met my share
of your colleagues.

00:18:10.812 --> 00:18:12.745
So where'd you serve?

00:18:12.747 --> 00:18:15.648
Oh. All the loveliest places.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.249
I was in the Middle East,

00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:18.785
South America of course.

00:18:18.787 --> 00:18:21.386
Ooh! North Carolina.

00:18:21.388 --> 00:18:24.757
And that tan line
on your ring finger?

00:18:24.759 --> 00:18:27.292
We don't wear wedding
rings while we work.

00:18:27.294 --> 00:18:30.262
Could be a possible pressure
point if you're captured.

00:18:30.264 --> 00:18:32.899
Either that, or you
just got a divorce.

00:18:32.901 --> 00:18:34.734
So we're leaving for Paldoñia.

00:18:34.736 --> 00:18:36.501
You know anything about it?

00:18:36.503 --> 00:18:37.970
Sure do.

00:18:37.972 --> 00:18:40.940
Paldoñia's like a...
Tim Burton movie.

00:18:40.942 --> 00:18:44.242
It's colorful, but
it's creepy as fuck.

00:18:44.244 --> 00:18:45.945
That's a new one.

00:18:45.947 --> 00:18:47.647
I have an exclusive interview

00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:50.515
with President Juan
Arturo Venegas.

00:18:50.517 --> 00:18:52.952
He doesn't do interviews.

00:18:52.954 --> 00:18:56.521
Um, with all due respect, do
you understand at all who...

00:18:56.523 --> 00:18:58.457
I think I understand quite well,

00:18:58.459 --> 00:19:00.459
but the real question
is do you understand

00:19:00.461 --> 00:19:02.229
why you're coming along?

00:19:03.932 --> 00:19:06.032
My guess is not
to give my opinion

00:19:06.034 --> 00:19:07.934
about Juan Arturo Venegas.

00:19:07.936 --> 00:19:10.970
Perfect. Then
this will be fine.

00:19:10.972 --> 00:19:12.872
I'll focus on Venegas.
You focus on making sure

00:19:12.874 --> 00:19:15.542
I don't get robbed or
kidnapped at the hotel.

00:19:19.714 --> 00:19:21.279
Pull!

00:19:24.384 --> 00:19:25.952
What's up, what's up?

00:19:25.954 --> 00:19:29.055
Welcome back to
"Infamous Daily Live."

00:19:29.057 --> 00:19:30.723
I'm here with GG Love,

00:19:30.725 --> 00:19:32.925
who went from doing time

00:19:32.927 --> 00:19:35.293
to being a multimillionaire
entrepreneur

00:19:35.295 --> 00:19:37.764
and founder of the Much
Loved clothing brand.

00:19:37.766 --> 00:19:39.564
Thanks for being here, GG.

00:19:39.566 --> 00:19:41.333
Pleasure's all mines, baby.

00:19:41.335 --> 00:19:44.336
Give us a spin. Show
off what you got.

00:19:44.338 --> 00:19:47.305
Wow! I can't wait to get one.

00:19:47.307 --> 00:19:48.540
So tell me...

00:19:48.542 --> 00:19:49.662
Have a good laugh? Oh, shit!

00:19:53.081 --> 00:19:54.947
Was that all an Internet
search could get you?

00:19:54.949 --> 00:19:57.315
Trust me. There's
far worse out there.

00:19:57.317 --> 00:19:58.985
Did you move to the States
when you were young?

00:19:58.987 --> 00:20:01.020
I noticed your British
passport when we boarded,

00:20:01.022 --> 00:20:03.355
and you slipped
your accent, so...

00:20:03.357 --> 00:20:04.690
probably moved here as a kid.

00:20:04.692 --> 00:20:05.958
I mean, if I had to guess.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.695
Nobody's asking
for your guesses.

00:20:08.897 --> 00:20:12.799
Why Paldoñia? Some
sort of image makeover?

00:20:12.801 --> 00:20:14.934
This might shock you, my dear,

00:20:14.936 --> 00:20:16.803
but I didn't take
a degree at Oxford

00:20:16.805 --> 00:20:19.839
to cover celebrity bar mitzvahs.

00:20:19.841 --> 00:20:21.841
Paldoñia has some
of the largest oil

00:20:21.843 --> 00:20:23.609
and natural gas
fields in the world,

00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:25.778
and Venegas is the
last pure autocrat

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.414
in the Western Hemisphere,
and he doesn't do interviews

00:20:29.416 --> 00:20:30.685
until now.

00:20:32.921 --> 00:20:36.722
OK. Just...

00:20:36.724 --> 00:20:39.926
just want me to sit
here and shut up then?

00:20:39.928 --> 00:20:42.831
Sounds absolutely brilliant.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.065
Miss Wellington,
welcome to Paldoñia!

00:21:19.067 --> 00:21:22.103
President Venegas, so
nice to meet... you.

00:21:24.571 --> 00:21:26.839
Ellie sends her regards.

00:21:26.841 --> 00:21:29.942
Oh, my God. You are
even more beautiful

00:21:29.944 --> 00:21:32.510
in person than on television.

00:21:32.512 --> 00:21:36.414
Thank you. Hoo. Ha ha ha!

00:21:37.819 --> 00:21:39.120
It's like that?

00:21:41.189 --> 00:21:42.757
Oh. That... that was a gift.

00:21:47.427 --> 00:21:49.061
What? I have a
permit for that.

00:21:49.063 --> 00:21:51.496
Before we begin, we
must take a selfie.

00:21:51.498 --> 00:21:52.967
Oh. Um...

00:21:54.769 --> 00:21:57.469
Ah. Yes. That's... um...

00:21:57.471 --> 00:21:58.771
It's a little bright out here.

00:21:58.773 --> 00:22:00.106
Yes? Oh. Oh!

00:22:00.108 --> 00:22:03.809
You approve? Yes.

00:22:03.811 --> 00:22:05.044
Ahh! It's great.

00:22:05.046 --> 00:22:06.544
My followers are
gonna love this.

00:22:12.486 --> 00:22:13.888
Use the whole fist?

00:22:18.525 --> 00:22:20.626
I bought that one. Yeah.

00:22:20.628 --> 00:22:22.194
So Ellie and you were roommates

00:22:22.196 --> 00:22:23.729
in the university, yes?

00:22:23.731 --> 00:22:25.563
Our second and
fourth years, yes.

00:22:25.565 --> 00:22:27.600
Hmm. Heh heh.

00:22:27.602 --> 00:22:30.670
Well, any friend of Ellie's
is welcome in Paldoñia.

00:22:30.672 --> 00:22:33.239
Tell me about her. How is she?

00:22:33.241 --> 00:22:35.509
Well, um...

00:22:37.078 --> 00:22:39.745
she is very happy in Kansas.

00:22:39.747 --> 00:22:42.214
I know. What's
in Kansas anyway?

00:22:42.216 --> 00:22:44.752
The rich rancher she married.

00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:45.965
What a pity.

00:22:46.486 --> 00:22:48.488
Not in Kansas anymore, huh?

00:22:51.491 --> 00:22:53.125
Was it a bad joke?

00:22:53.127 --> 00:22:54.694
No. "The
Wizard of Oz."

00:22:54.696 --> 00:22:56.128
It's one of my favorite movies.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.562
I should have introduced you.

00:22:57.564 --> 00:22:59.065
Mason is my protective detail.

00:22:59.067 --> 00:23:00.766
Of course
he is. Of course.

00:23:00.768 --> 00:23:02.969
Mason Pettits, CDI's finest,

00:23:02.971 --> 00:23:06.272
former Army Special
Forces, right?

00:23:06.274 --> 00:23:10.176
Maison Petite.
The little house.

00:23:10.178 --> 00:23:12.979
We do our own research, too.

00:23:12.981 --> 00:23:16.015
Ha ha ha! Ha!

00:23:16.017 --> 00:23:18.217
Vamanos!

00:23:53.154 --> 00:23:55.988
Would you like to
ride my stallion?

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:58.691
Not now, thanks.

00:23:58.693 --> 00:24:00.826
President Venegas, I
really appreciate you

00:24:00.828 --> 00:24:02.128
giving me this kind of access.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:03.896
Ho ho! Of course.

00:24:03.898 --> 00:24:05.231
It's like they say.

00:24:05.233 --> 00:24:08.234
A blind pig must use its nose.

00:24:08.236 --> 00:24:11.237
Ah. Ha ha.

00:24:11.239 --> 00:24:15.074
There are so many wonderful
things about my country.

00:24:15.076 --> 00:24:18.046
I can't wait for you to
share them with the world.

00:24:42.303 --> 00:24:45.973
Look. Mi gente. My people.

00:24:56.751 --> 00:25:00.822
There is a bright future
ahead of us, bright future.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.793
Heh.

00:25:07.795 --> 00:25:10.229
Ha ha. Freedom of speech is
very present in Paldoñia,

00:25:10.231 --> 00:25:11.964
but let's move on.

00:25:11.966 --> 00:25:13.901
Vamos. Vamos.
Adelante. Adelante.

00:25:28.349 --> 00:25:30.249
Just confirming.
We are still headed

00:25:30.251 --> 00:25:32.051
to your ranch tonight, right?

00:25:32.053 --> 00:25:34.186
I am taking you
to my country estate.

00:25:34.188 --> 00:25:35.990
I think you're gonna love it.

00:25:38.059 --> 00:25:39.358
Let's toast, huh?

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.026
OK. Yes.

00:25:41.028 --> 00:25:43.429
Ha ha! One for you,

00:25:43.431 --> 00:25:47.032
one for me,

00:25:47.034 --> 00:25:52.204
and we toast for
your safe travels...

00:25:52.206 --> 00:25:54.173
and for new friends.

00:25:54.175 --> 00:25:55.341
I like it. Yes.

00:25:55.343 --> 00:25:56.942
Ah, ah, ah.

00:25:56.944 --> 00:25:58.844
Arriba... Arriba...

00:25:58.846 --> 00:26:00.112
abajo... abajo...

00:26:00.114 --> 00:26:01.847
al centro... al centro...

00:26:01.849 --> 00:26:04.018
pa' dentro. OK. Ha ha ha!

00:26:05.186 --> 00:26:07.953
Ahh. Ahem. Heh.

00:26:07.955 --> 00:26:09.989
Uh, if you don't
mind, Mr. President,

00:26:09.991 --> 00:26:11.757
I'd love to go over a few
of my interview questions

00:26:11.759 --> 00:26:14.026
with you now. Yes, of course.

00:26:14.028 --> 00:26:17.062
No prepararse es
prepararse para fallar.

00:26:17.064 --> 00:26:19.999
Failing to prepare
is preparing to fail?

00:26:20.001 --> 00:26:23.804
Ooh. I love it. Ha ha ha!

00:26:31.379 --> 00:26:32.945
Ha ha ha!

00:26:32.947 --> 00:26:34.713
Be ready to fail, huh?

00:26:34.715 --> 00:26:36.250
I... ohh!

00:26:43.991 --> 00:26:45.391
What are we gonna do, Mason?

00:26:49.397 --> 00:26:51.399
Mason!

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.970
Oh, my God!

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.211
Aah! Stay down!

00:27:05.213 --> 00:27:07.112
Aah, Mason! Get down!

00:27:07.114 --> 00:27:08.447
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:27:10.117 --> 00:27:12.151
No, no, no, no, no!

00:27:15.056 --> 00:27:16.424
Mason?

00:27:18.526 --> 00:27:20.194
What's happening? Stay down!

00:27:31.105 --> 00:27:34.306
Oh! Ohh!

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.077
Aah!

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.082
What are you doing?

00:27:50.124 --> 00:27:51.325
Oh, shit!

00:27:53.995 --> 00:27:55.394
Get up. Get up. What?

00:27:55.396 --> 00:27:57.096
Get up. Put your
seat belts on now.

00:27:57.098 --> 00:27:58.266
Oh, God.

00:28:08.009 --> 00:28:09.343
Unh! Ohh!

00:28:24.358 --> 00:28:27.226
Ooh! Ow!

00:28:27.228 --> 00:28:31.463
Claire, are you OK? Yes? Yes.

00:28:33.834 --> 00:28:35.834
Told you this was mine.

00:28:35.836 --> 00:28:37.972
OK, OK.

00:28:39.907 --> 00:28:42.609
Hey. OK. Stay here.

00:28:42.611 --> 00:28:44.178
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:28:48.416 --> 00:28:49.850
Huh!

00:29:04.231 --> 00:29:06.498
Man.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.500
Hey.

00:29:10.471 --> 00:29:12.473
What part of "stay here"
did you guys not get?

00:29:34.929 --> 00:29:37.363
Oh, my back. Ohh.

00:29:37.365 --> 00:29:39.164
Oh. Just...

00:29:41.268 --> 00:29:42.968
OK. OK.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:44.637
Mr. Pettits. OK.

00:29:44.639 --> 00:29:47.272
Thank you very much.
God! Ohh! My back!

00:29:47.274 --> 00:29:48.574
Ahh. My back. Are you OK?

00:29:48.576 --> 00:29:50.376
Yeah. Just give me a second.

00:29:50.378 --> 00:29:52.279
Are you sure you're
OK? You want a massage?

00:29:54.315 --> 00:29:55.948
OK.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:57.282
What the hell just happened?

00:29:57.284 --> 00:29:58.584
What happened?

00:29:58.586 --> 00:30:00.953
Your one-man security
detail happened.

00:30:00.955 --> 00:30:03.389
He's a hero.

00:30:03.391 --> 00:30:05.357
Mason, what's going on?

00:30:05.359 --> 00:30:06.693
What's going on? This place is

00:30:06.695 --> 00:30:08.160
a shitshow like it always was.

00:30:08.162 --> 00:30:09.461
We never should have come.

00:30:09.463 --> 00:30:11.063
Let's go.

00:30:11.065 --> 00:30:13.031
Should we call for help?

00:30:13.033 --> 00:30:15.067
Yeah, but we'll call when
we're someplace safe.

00:30:15.069 --> 00:30:17.369
Ahem. Can you believe this?

00:30:17.371 --> 00:30:18.605
What?

00:30:18.607 --> 00:30:20.105
C'est un coup d'état.

00:30:20.107 --> 00:30:21.173
A coup?

00:30:21.175 --> 00:30:23.275
Putana! Merde!

00:30:23.277 --> 00:30:25.310
I cannot hide from this!

00:30:25.312 --> 00:30:29.649
Ha! Hiding seems like
a great idea right now.

00:30:29.651 --> 00:30:33.519
This is not a rebel
assassination attempt.

00:30:33.521 --> 00:30:36.188
One, really looks like it is.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.957
Two, you're screwed
regardless, so...

00:30:38.959 --> 00:30:41.193
I have to stop this.

00:30:41.195 --> 00:30:42.662
I think I just did.

00:30:42.664 --> 00:30:45.632
Stop the overthrow
of my government,

00:30:45.634 --> 00:30:48.400
and you will come
with me to the capital

00:30:48.402 --> 00:30:50.502
and help me protect my people.

00:30:50.504 --> 00:30:54.039
Newsflash... your people just
tried to kill you, all right?

00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:56.141
Count us out.

00:30:56.143 --> 00:30:57.209
Can you hand me my bag?

00:30:57.211 --> 00:30:59.244
What? My bags.

00:30:59.246 --> 00:31:00.680
We got to get you out of
here by the end of the day.

00:31:00.682 --> 00:31:02.247
You're never gonna need it.

00:31:02.249 --> 00:31:03.482
I'm with the
president of a country

00:31:03.484 --> 00:31:04.983
in the middle of a coup.

00:31:04.985 --> 00:31:07.119
This is the scoop of a lifetime.

00:31:07.121 --> 00:31:08.987
You got to be alive to have
the scoop of a lifetime, OK?

00:31:08.989 --> 00:31:10.989
You'll break your story
when you're someplace safe.

00:31:18.633 --> 00:31:21.166
What's that? A really big gun.

00:31:21.168 --> 00:31:22.403
Let's move.

00:31:27.676 --> 00:31:29.341
Come on.

00:31:29.343 --> 00:31:30.544
Ohh!

00:31:46.527 --> 00:31:48.429
Battement tend...

00:31:51.633 --> 00:31:53.434
En pointe.

00:31:57.739 --> 00:31:59.440
Yes.

00:32:02.243 --> 00:32:03.444
How's it?

00:32:05.714 --> 00:32:07.412
Everyone?

00:32:07.414 --> 00:32:09.116
Yes. Excellent.

00:32:11.686 --> 00:32:13.087
Sorry. Go ahead.

00:32:14.656 --> 00:32:17.055
I see.

00:32:17.057 --> 00:32:18.425
Be in touch then.

00:32:22.697 --> 00:32:25.767
Brava, brava, Marta. The swan.

00:32:29.336 --> 00:32:31.539
Papa has to go to work my dear.

00:32:32.841 --> 00:32:35.109
Encore, encore!

00:32:43.484 --> 00:32:44.653
Shit.

00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:50.556
Wait, wait, Mason.

00:32:50.558 --> 00:32:53.425
I c... I can't,
I can't, I can't.

00:32:53.427 --> 00:32:57.296
I can't. Ohh.

00:32:57.298 --> 00:32:59.398
I guess we're taking a break.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.167
Ohh.

00:33:02.169 --> 00:33:04.637
Are you OK, Miss Wellington?

00:33:04.639 --> 00:33:06.739
I'm good. Oh, good.

00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:09.642
So who's trying to kill us?

00:33:09.644 --> 00:33:11.811
Nobody. Nobody is
trying to kill us.

00:33:11.813 --> 00:33:13.414
They're trying to kill him.

00:33:14.686 --> 00:33:16.374
Who wants to kill you?

00:33:16.885 --> 00:33:18.419
Ah.

00:33:18.444 --> 00:33:21.830
A single insect may bring
down an entire country.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.080
Which insect wants
to kill you today?

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.260
I don't know, but I
intend to find out.

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:32.799
Oh. You have a
satellite phone.

00:33:32.801 --> 00:33:34.232
Who you gonna call?

00:33:34.234 --> 00:33:35.569
I'm calling for help.

00:33:38.539 --> 00:33:40.305
Earle. Yo. It's
Mason. We got hit.

00:33:40.307 --> 00:33:42.274
Shit! What happened?
You OK, Mason?

00:33:42.276 --> 00:33:43.610
Heading out of town, they
took out our vehicles.

00:33:43.612 --> 00:33:45.577
I got us out safe, but I...

00:33:45.579 --> 00:33:47.412
bro, we're stuck. I got
no idea where we're at.

00:33:47.414 --> 00:33:48.781
Is Wellington safe?

00:33:48.783 --> 00:33:50.415
Yeah. She's with
me, and Venegas

00:33:50.417 --> 00:33:51.918
is here, too.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.519
What? Why is he with you?

00:33:54.521 --> 00:33:55.922
What about his team?

00:33:55.924 --> 00:33:58.858
Dead. Bro, you got
to get us a ride.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.660
Hang tight.

00:34:00.662 --> 00:34:02.762
GPS has your position.

00:34:02.764 --> 00:34:06.431
There's a clearing...
3 klicks east.

00:34:06.433 --> 00:34:08.233
Exfil there by helo.

00:34:08.235 --> 00:34:09.602
I'm gonna call some
colleagues in the area.

00:34:09.604 --> 00:34:11.436
I'll get you picked up.

00:34:11.438 --> 00:34:13.407
Heh. So much for a milk run.

00:34:15.342 --> 00:34:17.376
May I use your phone? Nope.

00:34:17.378 --> 00:34:18.477
But I need to make a call.

00:34:18.479 --> 00:34:20.579
Heh. I don't care.

00:34:20.581 --> 00:34:22.749
Mason. What?

00:34:22.751 --> 00:34:24.784
Tell me why I should
do a favor for him.

00:34:24.786 --> 00:34:26.585
Well, for example,
because, uh, I can have

00:34:26.587 --> 00:34:29.388
you arrested for
being a foreign spy.

00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:30.823
Maybe I pull a coup
of my own then.

00:34:30.825 --> 00:34:32.692
Stop it, Mason!

00:34:37.732 --> 00:34:39.699
Singing? Dictators
don't get to sing.

00:34:39.701 --> 00:34:42.467
Really? Well, then go ahead.

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:43.870
Do it, Mr. Pettits.

00:34:43.872 --> 00:34:45.605
I am not afraid of death,

00:34:45.607 --> 00:34:47.674
and I am not afraid
of people like you.

00:34:47.676 --> 00:34:49.609
Do it.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:56.314
Hey, hey! Put the
gun down, please.

00:35:04.224 --> 00:35:05.792
Knock yourself out.

00:35:05.794 --> 00:35:08.360
Thank you. Don't worry.

00:35:08.362 --> 00:35:10.830
I'll make it petite.

00:35:23.477 --> 00:35:24.977
Hermanos.

00:35:24.979 --> 00:35:26.413
Señor.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.660
- Is this my speech?
- Yes.

00:35:38.685 --> 00:35:39.930
Is the lighting okay?

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.810
The lighting is perfect, Jefe.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:44.510
Thank you, General.

00:35:44.699 --> 00:35:46.766

Hello?

00:35:58.940 --> 00:35:59.940
Jorge,

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.160
Nephew!

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.780
Uncle?

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:03.910
Correct!

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.716
I'm out here walking
through the jungle!

00:36:07.741 --> 00:36:09.520
How are you?

00:36:09.545 --> 00:36:10.474
All good?

00:36:10.498 --> 00:36:12.498
Heh. Ha ha!

00:36:13.497 --> 00:36:14.975
How are you, Uncle?

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.300
I'm fantastic!

00:36:16.325 --> 00:36:17.935
I'm walking through the jungle

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.106
with an absolutely lovely woman.

00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:21.931
- The Gringo Journalist?
- Yes!

00:36:21.956 --> 00:36:24.325
The beautiful Claire Wellington.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:25.779
Uh-huh. Ah!

00:36:34.515 --> 00:36:36.048
Is he asking what I'm wearing?

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.684
No, he's describing
what you're wearing.

00:36:38.686 --> 00:36:41.020
Don't look at me. He's
your friend of a friend.

00:36:41.022 --> 00:36:43.488
Yeah. Just didn't
realize he and Ellie

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.091
kept in touch still.

00:36:45.093 --> 00:36:47.492
What? The interview.

00:36:47.494 --> 00:36:49.461
That's obviously why
he invited me here.

00:36:49.463 --> 00:36:51.097
He invited you?

00:36:51.099 --> 00:36:52.765
Why? Because I'm not just

00:36:52.767 --> 00:36:54.366
a celebrity news
reporter to you now?

00:36:54.368 --> 00:36:56.702
No. I thought you
landed the interview.

00:36:56.704 --> 00:36:59.471
Ha! Everybody's asked
him for an interview,

00:36:59.473 --> 00:37:01.506
but Paldoñia's been
basically a media blackout

00:37:01.508 --> 00:37:03.375
for the last decade.

00:37:03.377 --> 00:37:04.744
Then just like that,
he e-mailed me,

00:37:04.746 --> 00:37:06.411
asked me if I
wanted an interview.

00:37:06.413 --> 00:37:07.713
Why do you think you're here?

00:37:07.715 --> 00:37:09.449
I'm not totally clueless.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.230
Yes, yes, don't
worry. See you soon!

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.075
We were all worried for you.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.070
Sure. Great. God bless you!

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.950
My uncle isn't dead.

00:37:28.741 --> 00:37:31.122
Our partners will
not be pleased.

00:37:43.437 --> 00:37:45.017
Thank you.

00:37:45.019 --> 00:37:46.551
Please tell us you
have good news.

00:37:46.553 --> 00:37:48.120
Oh, I have wonderful news.

00:37:48.122 --> 00:37:50.156
I was just talking
to Jorge, my nephew.

00:37:50.158 --> 00:37:52.758
He's the one behind the coup.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.526
That's good news?

00:37:54.528 --> 00:37:55.929
Yes, it's great news.

00:37:55.954 --> 00:37:58.855
You see, I love my
nephew, but he's an idiot.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.846
So he... he just told you?

00:38:00.871 --> 00:38:02.403
No. He didn't
tell me anything,

00:38:02.428 --> 00:38:04.863
but he said everything. Hmm?

00:38:04.906 --> 00:38:06.839
He will not move a
finger if he knows

00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:08.473
that I am still alive,

00:38:08.475 --> 00:38:10.776
so I told him that
everything was OK

00:38:10.778 --> 00:38:13.478
and that we were
gonna go to see him.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.082
You see, you must
always stroke the head

00:38:16.084 --> 00:38:18.653
that you are going to cut off.

00:38:20.154 --> 00:38:21.888
So is he working
with the rebels?

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.488
No, no, no, no.

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:25.691
The rebels also think
that he's an idiot.

00:38:25.693 --> 00:38:27.693
Heh. Let's go.

00:38:27.695 --> 00:38:28.895
Back to the capital.

00:38:28.897 --> 00:38:31.563
Heh. No.

00:38:31.565 --> 00:38:33.498
No.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.567
Do what you want.

00:38:35.569 --> 00:38:37.105
We're getting out of here.

00:38:50.517 --> 00:38:52.018
We can't just leave him.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.621
Just did.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:59.158
I need to report this.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.093
We can't just let
another government

00:39:01.095 --> 00:39:03.095
in another poor
country get overthrown

00:39:03.097 --> 00:39:05.131
in another coup and
nobody pays attention.

00:39:05.133 --> 00:39:06.866
Come on. Don't let
Venegas suck you in.

00:39:06.868 --> 00:39:08.167
He's a textbook sociopath.

00:39:08.169 --> 00:39:09.936
He seems OK.

00:39:09.938 --> 00:39:11.237
Please. Read Hannah Arendt.

00:39:11.239 --> 00:39:14.006
I have.

00:39:14.008 --> 00:39:16.609
I'm well aware what
the world expects

00:39:16.611 --> 00:39:18.611
from Claire Wellington
at the moment,

00:39:18.613 --> 00:39:20.146
but I have sacrificed everything

00:39:20.148 --> 00:39:24.016
for my career... my family,
relationships, my life...

00:39:24.018 --> 00:39:25.885
so forgive me if I refuse to be

00:39:25.887 --> 00:39:27.720
the laughingstock who went
from winning a Peabody

00:39:27.722 --> 00:39:30.056
to covering celebrity man caves.

00:39:30.058 --> 00:39:31.991
This is my chance,

00:39:31.993 --> 00:39:34.494
and it's working out better
than I ever could have hoped.

00:39:35.997 --> 00:39:38.199
Yeah, it's one way
of looking at it.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.669
Err!

00:39:59.721 --> 00:40:01.687
Sebastian.

00:40:01.689 --> 00:40:03.956
Mason Pettits, we got a
call from your boss at CDI.

00:40:03.958 --> 00:40:05.725
Heard you needed a lift.

00:40:05.727 --> 00:40:07.126
Yeah, we sure do.

00:40:07.128 --> 00:40:09.729
Got an ETA of two
minutes for you.

00:40:09.731 --> 00:40:11.864
Got a spot where I
can set the bird down?

00:40:11.866 --> 00:40:13.666
Yeah, we're headed towards
the clearing right now.

00:40:13.668 --> 00:40:15.768
Uh, you got my GPS?

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:17.603
We're heading straight for it.

00:40:17.605 --> 00:40:19.874
You can't get here fast
enough. We'll be standing by.

00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:25.079
OK. Sit tight. We're getting
picked up in a few minutes.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:30.316
Are you sure we can't stay?

00:40:30.318 --> 00:40:32.084
Oh, I'm sure.

00:40:32.086 --> 00:40:33.953
Get you picked up
across the border.

00:40:33.955 --> 00:40:35.287
You'll find a Starbucks with
free Wi-Fi or something,

00:40:35.289 --> 00:40:37.923
break your story from there.

00:40:37.925 --> 00:40:40.592
Sure sure?

00:40:40.594 --> 00:40:42.263
You can't get a
Peabody if you're dead.

00:40:44.098 --> 00:40:45.965
What about Venegas?
You think he'll be OK?

00:40:45.967 --> 00:40:48.701
I don't give a
shit about Venegas!

00:40:48.703 --> 00:40:51.305
What is your deal with him?

00:41:15.696 --> 00:41:17.832
I can smell the free Wi-Fi now.

00:41:23.171 --> 00:41:25.738
Not good.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.809
Run! Run! What?!

00:41:57.738 --> 00:41:59.805
Aah!

00:41:59.807 --> 00:42:01.008
Aah!

00:42:10.751 --> 00:42:12.186
Aah!

00:42:17.125 --> 00:42:18.392
Agh! Aah! Aah!

00:42:20.061 --> 00:42:21.927
Aah! Aah!

00:42:21.929 --> 00:42:23.131
Come on!

00:42:31.973 --> 00:42:33.307
Oh, God!

00:42:34.809 --> 00:42:36.709
Come on.

00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:37.943
Are you kidding me?

00:42:37.945 --> 00:42:39.814
Embrace the suck!

00:43:06.107 --> 00:43:07.909
Aah! Ohh! Ohh!

00:43:09.143 --> 00:43:10.411
Aah!

00:43:13.447 --> 00:43:16.115
Still excited to cover a coup?

00:43:16.117 --> 00:43:18.252
Less and less honestly. Yeah.

00:43:54.822 --> 00:43:57.058
Shit! He's going
for another round.

00:44:01.295 --> 00:44:02.797
Stay put.

00:44:47.408 --> 00:44:49.377
Tell me you got that.

00:44:51.579 --> 00:44:53.145
Run!

00:44:53.147 --> 00:44:54.949
Run!

00:45:21.942 --> 00:45:23.811
Mason?

00:45:36.324 --> 00:45:38.159
Mason?

00:46:15.429 --> 00:46:17.231
Mason?

00:46:21.168 --> 00:46:23.137
Oh. Not Mason.

00:46:29.577 --> 00:46:32.213
Because hiding in a tree
is such a good idea.

00:46:59.373 --> 00:47:01.006
Huh!

00:47:20.629 --> 00:47:22.060
Are you OK?

00:47:22.062 --> 00:47:23.497
Yeah. I'm good.

00:47:25.566 --> 00:47:27.299
Do you need help?

00:47:27.301 --> 00:47:28.569
Enn.

00:47:45.386 --> 00:47:46.587
Ooh!

00:47:57.598 --> 00:48:00.167
You good? Ugh.

00:48:02.169 --> 00:48:05.204
Suddenly, I'm very glad
I paid you to tag along.

00:48:08.108 --> 00:48:09.374
Mason!

00:48:09.376 --> 00:48:10.745
Unh! Aah!

00:48:12.647 --> 00:48:14.279
Where is Venegas?

00:48:15.516 --> 00:48:16.751
Aah!

00:48:21.656 --> 00:48:23.455
I'm here.

00:48:23.457 --> 00:48:25.524
Ohh!

00:48:25.526 --> 00:48:27.259
Aah!

00:48:27.261 --> 00:48:28.496
Puta!

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:34.299
Oh. Miss Wellington,
I am... I am so sorry

00:48:34.301 --> 00:48:36.603
for the mess that I have made.

00:48:36.605 --> 00:48:38.205
Thank you.

00:48:39.674 --> 00:48:41.573
Where did you come from?

00:48:41.575 --> 00:48:43.344
From behind that tree.

00:48:44.713 --> 00:48:46.713
Not literally.

00:48:46.715 --> 00:48:48.449
What's up with the hand cannon?

00:48:50.184 --> 00:48:52.384
Juanita? Yeah.

00:48:52.386 --> 00:48:54.219
What kind of ego maniacal
psycho dictator

00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:57.024
would Venegas be if he
didn't have a big gun?

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.028
Point taken.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.237
Thank you for your help.

00:49:09.504 --> 00:49:11.464
You're welcome, Mr. Pettits.

00:49:38.754 --> 00:49:40.488
Colonel Koehorst.

00:49:47.918 --> 00:49:49.551
General Vásquez,

00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:52.311
my clients are very
disappointed that

00:49:52.313 --> 00:49:55.147
your uncle is still alive
and causing trouble.

00:49:55.149 --> 00:49:57.482
It would appear that
your men likewise

00:49:57.484 --> 00:49:59.318
failed to kill my uncle.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.655
Certainly our arrangement's
off to a shaky start.

00:50:02.996 --> 00:50:05.725
My clients need assurance that

00:50:05.727 --> 00:50:09.330
their investment in your
country remains secure.

00:50:11.498 --> 00:50:13.400
Is that clear?

00:50:17.371 --> 00:50:20.172
Yes. Ahem.

00:50:20.174 --> 00:50:21.708
Good.

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:23.308
Thank you.

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:25.714
Better one man dies
instead of a thousand.

00:50:50.939 --> 00:50:53.173
Ahem.

00:50:55.844 --> 00:50:57.779
Thanks. Yeah.

00:51:01.783 --> 00:51:03.217
Ahh.

00:51:06.821 --> 00:51:11.658
Well, this is just... awesome.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.927
Yeah.

00:51:16.765 --> 00:51:19.197
So how'd you get wounded?

00:51:19.199 --> 00:51:22.336
Your back. Saw you've
been favoring it.

00:51:24.839 --> 00:51:26.606
God, I'm sorry
for trying to have

00:51:26.608 --> 00:51:28.540
a human moment with you
in the middle of a jungle

00:51:28.542 --> 00:51:30.745
where we could
die at any second.

00:51:36.618 --> 00:51:39.420
Mission I was on went
sideways a while back.

00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:44.657
I got injured. My back hurts.

00:51:44.659 --> 00:51:46.659
Did that happen here?

00:51:46.661 --> 00:51:47.929
Yeah.

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:51.532
It was my last mission.

00:51:54.636 --> 00:51:58.604
And so you're married...
or were married?

00:51:58.606 --> 00:52:00.873
I didn't quite follow
with the ring thing.

00:52:00.875 --> 00:52:03.776
Heh.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.881
Yes.

00:52:08.482 --> 00:52:10.482
Probably separated by now.

00:52:10.484 --> 00:52:12.752
Hmm.

00:52:12.754 --> 00:52:14.386
I was just way better
at being an operator

00:52:14.388 --> 00:52:16.891
than I am at normal,
day-to-day life.

00:52:18.258 --> 00:52:20.559
Then I got hurt, then I got out,

00:52:20.561 --> 00:52:23.328
and then I just sucked.

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:25.732
I got low.

00:52:27.736 --> 00:52:30.670
Took me years to figure
out how to become a lawyer.

00:52:30.672 --> 00:52:32.337
Wait. You're a lawyer?

00:52:32.339 --> 00:52:33.740
Yeah. Officially.

00:52:33.742 --> 00:52:34.974
Passed the Bar, whole 9.

00:52:34.976 --> 00:52:37.043
Ha!

00:52:37.045 --> 00:52:38.811
Thought it would make
me feel more normal.

00:52:38.813 --> 00:52:40.545
Mmm.

00:52:40.547 --> 00:52:43.750
Turns out it just made
me hate myself more.

00:52:43.752 --> 00:52:46.451
So you got into
private security?

00:52:46.453 --> 00:52:47.754
Yeah.

00:52:47.756 --> 00:52:49.789
How long you been
doing that now?

00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:53.291
Uh, it's what, 5...

00:52:53.293 --> 00:52:55.594
4... 3 days?

00:52:55.596 --> 00:52:58.998
What? CDI said you
were their best.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.033
You saw me take
out a helicopter.

00:53:01.035 --> 00:53:04.469
I mean, I think you got
your money's worth, right?

00:53:04.471 --> 00:53:06.606
I mean, come on. That was...

00:53:06.608 --> 00:53:08.375
that was pretty cool.

00:53:11.045 --> 00:53:13.413
That was pretty damn cool.

00:53:32.867 --> 00:53:35.101
Uh, we should go around.

00:53:35.103 --> 00:53:36.602
How rude would that be?

00:53:36.604 --> 00:53:37.870
It probably isn't safe.

00:53:37.872 --> 00:53:39.605
It's very safe.

00:53:39.607 --> 00:53:42.541
Welcome to Sabrina, my home.

00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:49.615
Heh heh.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:58.092
Ahh. Ha! Ha ha ha!

00:54:02.529 --> 00:54:03.930
Claire, Mason,

00:54:03.932 --> 00:54:06.132
this is my oldest
friend Ernesto Sandoval.

00:54:06.134 --> 00:54:08.734
He is the leader
of this village.

00:54:08.736 --> 00:54:10.738
It's an honor.

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:17.879
Oh! Oh!

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:23.630
You're much more
beautiful than on TV.

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.413
The Hulk.

00:54:27.438 --> 00:54:28.696
The Hulk scares me.

00:54:32.904 --> 00:54:34.094
What did he say?

00:54:34.119 --> 00:54:35.290
Something funny, I guess.

00:54:35.315 --> 00:54:36.438
This is Pepino.

00:54:36.463 --> 00:54:38.305
He is the, the
son-in-law of the chief.

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:39.866
He will give us a ride
into town tomorrow.

00:54:39.868 --> 00:54:42.101
Tomorrow? Yes, Mason.

00:54:42.103 --> 00:54:43.669
Nobody travels in this region

00:54:43.671 --> 00:54:44.937
of the country at night.

00:54:44.939 --> 00:54:46.438
Not even mercenaries.

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:47.707
Consider it a chance to rest

00:54:47.709 --> 00:54:49.809
and wash off the blood.

00:54:49.811 --> 00:54:51.010
OK.

00:54:52.881 --> 00:54:54.113
Uh...

00:55:09.063 --> 00:55:10.495
Ohh! Oh, my God!

00:55:10.497 --> 00:55:11.563
Ha ha ha!

00:55:11.565 --> 00:55:12.732
I just... I didn't...

00:55:12.734 --> 00:55:13.799
didn't see anything.

00:55:13.801 --> 00:55:15.500
Whew!

00:55:15.502 --> 00:55:17.904
Oh. Hoo!

00:55:17.906 --> 00:55:20.008
Nice ink, woman.

00:55:22.677 --> 00:55:25.878
Color me impressed,
Mr. Pettits.

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.749
Not petite at all.

00:55:29.516 --> 00:55:31.549
Shall we do the interview?

00:55:31.551 --> 00:55:32.954
Huh?

00:55:47.168 --> 00:55:49.467
So what do you
want me to do again?

00:55:49.469 --> 00:55:52.638
Just a standard two-shot.

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:56.108
Didn't exactly learn
that in basic training.

00:55:56.110 --> 00:55:59.912
Just make sure we're
both in the frame.

00:55:59.914 --> 00:56:02.582
Shall we begin? Please.

00:56:06.154 --> 00:56:07.552
OK. Let me just...

00:56:07.554 --> 00:56:09.021
We're rolling?

00:56:09.023 --> 00:56:11.491
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:56:14.528 --> 00:56:16.896
President Venegas, thank
you for speaking to me

00:56:16.898 --> 00:56:20.232
about the events that have
transpired over the past 12 hours.

00:56:20.234 --> 00:56:21.867
I truly
appreciate the opportunity

00:56:21.869 --> 00:56:23.936
of speaking with you.

00:56:23.938 --> 00:56:25.705
The world will soon
learn that earlier

00:56:25.707 --> 00:56:27.539
this morning you survived
an assassination attempt

00:56:27.541 --> 00:56:28.674
that resulted in the deaths

00:56:28.676 --> 00:56:31.043
of your entire security team.

00:56:31.045 --> 00:56:33.012
Sadly, yes.

00:56:33.014 --> 00:56:36.682
Who do you think is behind
this attempted coup?

00:56:36.684 --> 00:56:38.918
Our land and its mineral
resources have been exploited

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.754
by outsiders for
a very long time,

00:56:41.756 --> 00:56:43.255
and it is no secret
that these outsiders

00:56:43.257 --> 00:56:46.558
have propped up my
presidency for many years

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.961
while I turned my
back on my people.

00:56:48.963 --> 00:56:51.764
The CIA, the SAS,
they're only a tool

00:56:51.766 --> 00:56:54.800
to influence leaders like
me in countries like mine,

00:56:54.802 --> 00:56:56.669
but the real power has
always been in the hands

00:56:56.671 --> 00:56:59.905
of CEOs and shareholders
that make billions

00:56:59.907 --> 00:57:02.975
out of our natural resources
on the back of my people.

00:57:02.977 --> 00:57:06.779
So the corporations were behind
the attempt on your life?

00:57:06.781 --> 00:57:08.881
I was with you. The
attackers seemed like

00:57:08.883 --> 00:57:10.850
professional soldiers.

00:57:10.852 --> 00:57:13.285
What can't these
people buy, Claire?

00:57:13.287 --> 00:57:16.188
You think an assassination
attempt is scary?

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:18.324
Try telling the CEO of
a global energy company

00:57:18.326 --> 00:57:20.826
to go fuck his mother and
watch your currency drop

00:57:20.828 --> 00:57:24.562
70% by the end of
the conference call.

00:57:24.564 --> 00:57:27.769
Paldoñia has been blessed
with a second chance.

00:57:29.904 --> 00:57:33.739
In my fists are lanthanides,

00:57:33.741 --> 00:57:36.108
rare earth metals that
are the core component

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:39.577
for every new technology,
cell phones, tablets,

00:57:39.579 --> 00:57:41.714
electric cars, MRI machines.

00:57:41.716 --> 00:57:43.249
These corporations,
they want to exploit

00:57:43.251 --> 00:57:45.684
our new resource by a
pittance of what it's worth,

00:57:45.686 --> 00:57:48.087
and I have told them
that I will not allow it,

00:57:48.089 --> 00:57:49.822
which is why they're
trying to kill me.

00:57:49.824 --> 00:57:52.825
Paldoñia will become
the number one provider

00:57:52.827 --> 00:57:56.130
of the world's most
precious metal.

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.060
My promise, and my legacy

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.560
is that wealth from these metals

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.235
will be invested
solely and exclusively

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:07.110
to enrich the
people of Paldonia.

00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:08.560
Long Live Paldonia!

00:58:15.216 --> 00:58:17.817
Quite a puff piece you got here.

00:58:17.819 --> 00:58:19.053
Yeah.

00:58:25.893 --> 00:58:27.626
The bridge.
Here they come.

00:58:27.628 --> 00:58:28.994
Do you remember that?

00:58:28.996 --> 00:58:31.831
You come back. Ba
ba ba ba! Take that!

00:58:40.007 --> 00:58:41.640
Right?

00:58:41.642 --> 00:58:44.143
I'm telling you.

00:58:44.145 --> 00:58:45.778
- You saved my life.
- Yes.

00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:47.281
Very impressive.

00:58:59.827 --> 00:59:02.128
Whoo!

00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:04.363
Más, más.

00:59:27.989 --> 00:59:30.892
Bravo! Bravo!

00:59:53.347 --> 00:59:56.015
Y-you don't have to
sleep in a chair, Mason.

00:59:56.017 --> 00:59:57.752
I've slept in worse.

01:00:02.407 --> 01:00:06.243
Want to play a game to
see who gets the bed?

01:00:08.496 --> 01:00:11.836
OK. If you know what this is,

01:00:11.861 --> 01:00:14.161
I'm gonna be in trouble.

01:00:16.437 --> 01:00:18.407
That's a mandala.

01:00:18.839 --> 01:00:21.840
I'm guessing you
got it in India,

01:00:21.842 --> 01:00:23.144
work trip.

01:00:24.508 --> 01:00:27.913
Ha. OK.

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:29.883
OK.

01:00:29.908 --> 01:00:34.277
This is Latin.

01:00:34.455 --> 01:00:37.890
"She flies with
her own wings."

01:00:37.892 --> 01:00:39.458
That's Latin? It, um...

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.227
ahem... it's cool.

01:00:41.229 --> 01:00:43.229
Yeah. I got it a few years ago

01:00:43.231 --> 01:00:46.232
as a reminder that everything's
gonna work out fine.

01:00:46.234 --> 01:00:49.401
And why would you
need that reminder,

01:00:49.403 --> 01:00:52.137
aside from being here with
an inexperienced bodyguard

01:00:52.139 --> 01:00:53.806
and being hunted by mercenaries?

01:00:53.808 --> 01:00:56.391
Oh. Ttt, ttt, tt.

01:00:56.844 --> 01:00:58.112
Stop.

01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:02.481
Um... heh.

01:01:02.483 --> 01:01:04.218
Can you see that?

01:01:05.853 --> 01:01:07.920
Yep. Uh, anarchy?

01:01:07.922 --> 01:01:10.956
What, do you not believe
in any form of government?

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:14.260
I didn't when I was a teenager.

01:01:14.262 --> 01:01:17.096
I was very rebellious.

01:01:17.098 --> 01:01:18.397
I can buy that.

01:01:18.399 --> 01:01:20.566
Hmm. It got me
into journalism,

01:01:20.568 --> 01:01:23.836
you know, confronting power,

01:01:23.838 --> 01:01:27.573
fighting governments
to get to the truth.

01:01:27.575 --> 01:01:30.276
What's not to love?

01:01:30.278 --> 01:01:31.910
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

01:01:31.912 --> 01:01:33.479
So whatever you thought,

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:35.247
I came here for the chance

01:01:35.249 --> 01:01:36.849
to confront a dictator

01:01:36.851 --> 01:01:38.250
and hold power to account.

01:01:38.252 --> 01:01:39.518
That's why I came here.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.855
Not for my career.

01:01:42.857 --> 01:01:45.224
Maybe a little
bit for my career.

01:01:45.226 --> 01:01:47.359
Heh.

01:01:47.361 --> 01:01:49.363
Now, you tell me something.

01:01:51.832 --> 01:01:53.367
Good night.

01:01:57.938 --> 01:02:00.039
Are you enjoying this?

01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:02.975
I'm just doing my job.

01:02:02.977 --> 01:02:05.346
Yeah. Me, too.

01:02:06.914 --> 01:02:09.350
I c... I can't. Ahem. I can't.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.487
You still love her.

01:02:15.489 --> 01:02:17.058
Yeah.

01:02:23.331 --> 01:02:25.497
Timing, right?

01:02:25.499 --> 01:02:28.269
Yeah. The worst. Ha ha ha!

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.573
Good night, Mr. Pettits.

01:02:35.443 --> 01:02:37.211
Good night, Miss Wellington.

01:02:57.531 --> 01:02:59.264
Morning.

01:02:59.266 --> 01:03:02.167
Yo. We got to go.

01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:03.537
Heh.

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:07.973
Aww. You're still
not gonna let me go

01:03:07.975 --> 01:03:10.409
to Puerto Santiago to
tell this story, huh?

01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:12.544
That's a negative. You
got your exclusive.

01:03:12.546 --> 01:03:15.648
We get you to safety,
you break your story.

01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:18.050
Do you think I have
enough of a story?

01:03:18.052 --> 01:03:21.420
I mean, yes, I have
Venegas telling his side,

01:03:21.422 --> 01:03:23.956
but it could still be
dismissed as the rantings

01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:25.958
of a dictator trying
to explain away

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.226
a popular revolt.

01:03:27.228 --> 01:03:28.529
That is true.

01:03:30.164 --> 01:03:32.264
The world has always
been largely apathetic

01:03:32.266 --> 01:03:34.066
towards my country.

01:03:34.068 --> 01:03:38.036
That has served many
well but not my people.

01:03:38.038 --> 01:03:40.640
That is why today I am
going to Puerto Santiago

01:03:40.642 --> 01:03:42.474
for the future of my people.

01:03:42.476 --> 01:03:44.410
Very inspiring.
I'm just gonna move

01:03:44.412 --> 01:03:46.378
the delusions of saving your
people to the back burner

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:49.183
and not getting us killed
to the front burner.

01:03:51.085 --> 01:03:52.619
Why are you here, Mason?

01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:54.553
What? Yes.

01:03:54.555 --> 01:03:57.556
Why are you here in Paldoñia?

01:03:57.558 --> 01:03:59.224
For her. To protect her.

01:03:59.226 --> 01:04:01.728
Really? That's why
you think you're here?

01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:03.630
Hmm. For such a cynical man,

01:04:03.632 --> 01:04:06.633
you are hopelessly naive, Mason.

01:04:06.635 --> 01:04:11.972
Out of all places,
you were sent here.

01:04:14.108 --> 01:04:16.343
The question is why, Mason.

01:04:43.404 --> 01:04:45.003
Yo. It's Mason.

01:04:45.005 --> 01:04:46.739
Mace. Are you OK? I'm
freaking out here.

01:04:46.741 --> 01:04:48.605
Yeah. What's the story, bro?

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:50.643
You sent me down here because
you thought I'd roll over?

01:04:50.645 --> 01:04:52.200
Maybe I was too big of
a mess to handle it?

01:04:52.224 --> 01:04:53.924
Because I, like, owned
a bunch of these dudes.

01:04:53.948 --> 01:04:56.158
What are you talking
about? Come on, man.

01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:58.097
You really gonna try to
convince me you sent me

01:04:58.122 --> 01:05:00.223
down here randomly to meet the
guy who killed half our friends,

01:05:00.247 --> 01:05:02.080
and then the day I get
here, by coincidence,

01:05:02.122 --> 01:05:03.555
there's a coup with a
bunch of South Africans?

01:05:03.557 --> 01:05:05.424
It should be great.

01:05:05.426 --> 01:05:07.908
Mace, it's not what
you think, all right?

01:05:07.933 --> 01:05:09.233
Just breathe.

01:05:09.258 --> 01:05:11.693
I love you like
a brother. Yeah?

01:05:11.733 --> 01:05:14.293
The only thing I can't figure out
is why you needed me down here.

01:05:15.536 --> 01:05:17.949
They wanted you
to dispose of him.

01:05:19.206 --> 01:05:20.439
Kill Venegas?

01:05:20.441 --> 01:05:21.957
At his ranch.

01:05:21.982 --> 01:05:24.309
One of his bodyguards
was gonna get you a gun,

01:05:24.311 --> 01:05:25.947
sneak you into his bedroom.

01:05:25.972 --> 01:05:27.379
Yeah, but why me?

01:05:27.381 --> 01:05:28.737
I thought it'd be a
gift to take out the guy

01:05:28.761 --> 01:05:30.516
who killed our brothers,

01:05:30.518 --> 01:05:32.518
but apparently his
nephew thought Venegas

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.087
was hip to it, and
he jumped the gun.

01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:36.366
I never would've
sent you down there

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:38.524
if I thought there
was gonna be a coup.

01:05:38.526 --> 01:05:40.627
Seb, what kind of insanity
have you gotten yourself into?

01:05:40.629 --> 01:05:44.263
Look. Security contracting,

01:05:44.265 --> 01:05:46.733
you deal with some shady people.

01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:48.333
Some of it rubs off on you.

01:05:48.335 --> 01:05:50.168
Who are these
people? Who paid you?

01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:52.404
The South Africans
are contractors, too.

01:05:52.406 --> 01:05:55.574
They approached me when the
Wellington interview happened.

01:05:55.576 --> 01:05:57.844
They... they... they rep people
who want to take control of the...

01:05:57.846 --> 01:06:00.512
The lanthanides. Right.

01:06:00.514 --> 01:06:02.281
Mace, there's an easy fix here.

01:06:02.283 --> 01:06:03.850
Put a bullet in Venegas.

01:06:03.852 --> 01:06:05.317
Do it for the guys we lost.

01:06:05.319 --> 01:06:06.853
Do it for his country.

01:06:06.855 --> 01:06:08.422
Do it for the world.

01:06:10.157 --> 01:06:13.160
Mace? Ma...

01:06:28.877 --> 01:06:30.475
Hello?

01:06:30.477 --> 01:06:31.510
Honey?

01:06:31.512 --> 01:06:32.779
Hi, Daddy.

01:06:32.781 --> 01:06:34.730
Hey. Uh...

01:06:35.316 --> 01:06:38.216
hey. I, um... I just
wanted to tell you

01:06:38.218 --> 01:06:39.585
that I love you
and Mommy so much.

01:06:39.587 --> 01:06:41.688
I love you too, Daddy.

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:43.522
Daddy, Mommy is sad.

01:06:43.524 --> 01:06:45.792
You should come home.

01:06:45.794 --> 01:06:47.191
Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:47.216 --> 01:06:48.560
I... I promise
I'll be home soon.

01:06:48.562 --> 01:06:49.613
Hey. Is... is Mommy there?

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:51.463
Can you put Mom on
the phone right now?

01:06:51.465 --> 01:06:54.366
OK, but she told
Grandma that she doesn't

01:06:54.368 --> 01:06:56.201
want to talk to you
again until you get

01:06:56.203 --> 01:06:57.502
your shit together.

01:06:57.504 --> 01:06:59.527
Heh. Ahem.

01:06:59.552 --> 01:07:01.586
Just put mom on the
phone, sweetheart.

01:07:01.611 --> 01:07:04.043
Mommy! Daddy's on the phone.

01:07:04.068 --> 01:07:05.321
OK, honey. You go get ready.

01:07:05.346 --> 01:07:06.615
OK.

01:07:08.717 --> 01:07:10.415
Mason? Hey.

01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:11.699
Where are you?

01:07:11.724 --> 01:07:13.562
I'm just in a shop
getting Casey something.

01:07:13.587 --> 01:07:15.624
Listen. Um...

01:07:18.325 --> 01:07:21.058
I just wanted to say thank you

01:07:21.763 --> 01:07:23.295
for sticking with
me through all this

01:07:23.297 --> 01:07:25.152
and that I love you very much.

01:07:25.634 --> 01:07:28.600
Oh. OK. I mean, you're
kind of scaring me,

01:07:28.602 --> 01:07:29.869
uh, with that. No, no.

01:07:29.871 --> 01:07:32.404
It's, it's... don't
worry. Don't worry.

01:07:32.406 --> 01:07:33.873
I love you.

01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:38.611
I... I love you, too, so much.

01:07:38.613 --> 01:07:42.386
Please just come
home in one piece.

01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:45.687
I'm on my way. OK.

01:07:50.324 --> 01:07:51.893
Thank God for that.

01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:06.678
So as you walk to this...

01:08:06.703 --> 01:08:08.869
All right. I'll
use some of the skirt. Yes.

01:08:08.894 --> 01:08:11.394
You walk into
position right here,

01:08:11.419 --> 01:08:12.719
and then you go like

01:08:12.747 --> 01:08:14.589
Mason?

01:08:14.828 --> 01:08:15.902
Hey.

01:08:15.927 --> 01:08:17.855
We're heading for
the border tonight.

01:08:17.881 --> 01:08:18.824
What? What?

01:08:18.849 --> 01:08:20.113
We're leaving, and that's that.

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:20.917
No, no. Wait. Hey!

01:08:20.942 --> 01:08:22.740
Don't give me a reason.

01:08:27.327 --> 01:08:28.730
Ohh!

01:08:47.236 --> 01:08:49.425
Where's Venegas?

01:08:54.455 --> 01:08:56.557
Venegas!

01:08:57.659 --> 01:08:59.183
Venegas!

01:08:59.208 --> 01:09:00.684
Dude, stop following us already.

01:09:00.708 --> 01:09:01.933
I could say
the same thing to you,

01:09:01.957 --> 01:09:03.129
but I have much better manners.

01:09:03.153 --> 01:09:05.378
Mi amigo has a car. Come on!

01:09:06.353 --> 01:09:09.722
I said,
Where is President Venegas?

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:14.770
I said,

01:09:14.795 --> 01:09:16.949
Where is President Venegas?

01:09:18.046 --> 01:09:19.948
Nesto Sandoval.

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:24.097
Where is President Venegas?

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:41.128
This is your car?

01:09:41.241 --> 01:09:42.683
Sí señor.

01:09:43.211 --> 01:09:44.711
It doesn't look very fast.

01:09:44.736 --> 01:09:46.571
What are we gonna
do with this thing?

01:09:52.677 --> 01:09:53.913
Where's Venegas?

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.093
Wait, wait, wait.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

01:10:07.095 --> 01:10:08.543
Let him go.

01:10:08.568 --> 01:10:10.000
It's the only way out of this.

01:10:10.025 --> 01:10:11.925
If they kill him here,
they kill every person

01:10:11.966 --> 01:10:14.100
in this village.

01:10:16.738 --> 01:10:18.254
I hate you.

01:10:24.578 --> 01:10:26.014
Hey!

01:10:28.817 --> 01:10:31.651
You're looking for Venegas?

01:10:31.653 --> 01:10:33.986
Here is Venegas!

01:10:33.988 --> 01:10:37.123
Um... Can you ride?

01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:38.456
I'll manage.

01:10:38.458 --> 01:10:39.558
All right.

01:10:45.365 --> 01:10:46.464
OK. Hold on.

01:10:46.466 --> 01:10:48.100
Huh! Ohh!

01:10:48.102 --> 01:10:50.705
OK. Oh.

01:10:57.145 --> 01:10:58.443
Ohh! Get on.

01:10:58.445 --> 01:10:59.912
What?! Get on!

01:10:59.914 --> 01:11:01.546
No, no! I am very
afraid of horses.

01:11:01.548 --> 01:11:03.082
Half of your pictures
are on horses.

01:11:03.084 --> 01:11:05.910
It was Photoshopped. Err!

01:11:07.155 --> 01:11:09.789
Ohh! OK. OK.

01:11:09.791 --> 01:11:12.058
Let's go!

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.727
Aah! Aah!

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:19.464
OK. OK. Oh! OK.

01:11:19.466 --> 01:11:22.400
Ooh! Oh! Aah!

01:11:22.402 --> 01:11:24.136
Aah! Mason: Claire, come on!

01:11:37.819 --> 01:11:39.652
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:11:39.654 --> 01:11:41.120
Aah! Aah!

01:11:41.122 --> 01:11:42.822
Hold onto my waist!

01:11:42.824 --> 01:11:44.790
Ohh! Aah!

01:11:44.792 --> 01:11:46.759
This isn't weird at all.

01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:50.696
Let's go! Get them!

01:11:58.706 --> 01:12:00.538
Hang tight!

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.174
Claire, this way!

01:12:02.176 --> 01:12:03.843
Wait, wait, wait!

01:12:14.188 --> 01:12:16.789
Claire, follow me!

01:12:17.926 --> 01:12:19.459
Aah!

01:12:25.133 --> 01:12:26.999
Aah! Hang on!

01:12:34.842 --> 01:12:36.508
Stay there. Stay there.

01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:38.210
Do not move.

01:12:38.212 --> 01:12:41.781
Get up. Come here. Come here.

01:12:41.783 --> 01:12:43.249
Stay still.

01:12:43.251 --> 01:12:44.986
Hello, Miss Wellington.

01:12:47.255 --> 01:12:49.090
May I call you Claire?

01:12:51.491 --> 01:12:52.692
Where's Claire?

01:12:52.694 --> 01:12:54.461
She was right behind us.

01:12:56.998 --> 01:12:58.166
Oh.

01:13:00.735 --> 01:13:02.234
Don't worry.

01:13:02.236 --> 01:13:06.105
They won't hurt her
if I'm still alive.

01:13:06.107 --> 01:13:07.740
Looks like I'm going
to Puerto Santiago.

01:13:07.742 --> 01:13:09.809
Excellent!

01:13:09.811 --> 01:13:14.514
Aah! What?! Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.220
So you take money to
make private wars?

01:13:21.222 --> 01:13:22.888
What's that like?

01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:25.291
Why don't you ask
your Green Beret?

01:13:25.293 --> 01:13:28.094
I would, but I seem to have
been kidnapped by mercenaries.

01:13:28.096 --> 01:13:30.629
Sweetheart, we just saved
you from the worst dictator

01:13:30.631 --> 01:13:33.165
this continent has ever seen.

01:13:33.167 --> 01:13:35.134
I guess I missed the
chivalry while you were

01:13:35.136 --> 01:13:36.302
shooting at me.

01:13:36.304 --> 01:13:38.771
We were shooting at him.

01:13:38.773 --> 01:13:40.572
Our group has been
contracted on behalf

01:13:40.574 --> 01:13:43.541
of the people of Paldoñia.

01:13:43.543 --> 01:13:45.011
You mean, a
corporate-backed coup

01:13:45.013 --> 01:13:46.645
of a sovereign nation?

01:13:46.647 --> 01:13:48.180
You know, most journalists cause

01:13:48.182 --> 01:13:50.282
chaos and frenzy
but have no idea

01:13:50.284 --> 01:13:52.151
what's actually going on.

01:13:52.153 --> 01:13:54.620
We are here to bring
stability and peace

01:13:54.622 --> 01:13:57.757
to a complicated situation.

01:13:57.759 --> 01:13:59.658
You really think
that your reporting

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:02.728
can change the will
of the powerful?

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.597
This might sound
crazy, but, yes, I do.

01:14:05.599 --> 01:14:07.900
Kind of part of the gig.
It certainly sounds nice,

01:14:07.902 --> 01:14:08.934
and I wish you
were right, Claire.

01:14:08.936 --> 01:14:10.336
I really do.

01:14:10.338 --> 01:14:12.805
Unfortunately,
people are foolish.

01:14:12.807 --> 01:14:14.140
People just want honesty.

01:14:14.142 --> 01:14:15.708
They don't know what they want.

01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:17.076
They can't see what matters.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:19.812
They need looking after.

01:14:19.814 --> 01:14:21.180
So what matters?

01:14:21.182 --> 01:14:24.016
What matters is power.

01:14:24.018 --> 01:14:27.286
You can hold it and use it.

01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:29.155
And who's using you?

01:14:29.157 --> 01:14:32.258
Well, Claire, certainly
people who don't like

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.260
what you're doing.

01:14:34.262 --> 01:14:37.732
They don't give a rat's
ass about journalists.

01:14:41.803 --> 01:14:42.935
How much further?

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:44.070
We're almost there.

01:14:44.072 --> 01:14:45.840
It's just over the ridge.

01:14:55.383 --> 01:14:58.250
What's with the singing, man?

01:14:58.252 --> 01:15:00.086
You noticed?

01:15:00.088 --> 01:15:04.356
Well, I believe that when
one encounters danger,

01:15:04.358 --> 01:15:06.125
you should sing to it.

01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:08.227
You care to try?

01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:09.929
Not much of a singer.

01:15:09.931 --> 01:15:11.730
Not much of a dancer either.

01:15:11.732 --> 01:15:13.766
Ha ha ha!

01:15:13.768 --> 01:15:15.067
You're not afraid
of a big belly laugh

01:15:15.069 --> 01:15:16.135
every now and again, huh?

01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:17.903
Oh. Of course not.

01:15:17.905 --> 01:15:20.942
I believe that one should
always remember to laugh.

01:15:22.743 --> 01:15:24.779
Well, I found out why I'm here.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.314
Oh.

01:15:28.316 --> 01:15:31.117
They wanted me to kill you.

01:15:31.119 --> 01:15:32.852
That makes sense.

01:15:32.854 --> 01:15:34.420
It does? Of course.

01:15:34.422 --> 01:15:36.922
You blame me for shooting
down your helicopter,

01:15:36.924 --> 01:15:39.959
for your friends dying,
for your life ever since.

01:15:39.961 --> 01:15:42.328
Then my late bodyguard
Manuel gives you a gun

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:43.929
and lets you into my bedroom.

01:15:43.931 --> 01:15:45.197
Wait. You knew about that?

01:15:45.199 --> 01:15:46.866
I don't stay in power

01:15:46.868 --> 01:15:49.268
by not knowing things, Mason.

01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:50.903
I'd be so bad at
being a dictator.

01:15:50.905 --> 01:15:52.438
No. You'd be great at it.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:55.307
It's just practice.

01:15:55.309 --> 01:15:59.111
There is something important
I need to tell you, though.

01:15:59.113 --> 01:16:01.280
I didn't shoot down
your helicopter.

01:16:01.282 --> 01:16:02.882
Come on, man.

01:16:02.884 --> 01:16:04.683
I know you didn't personally.

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:07.153
It was friendly fire.

01:16:07.155 --> 01:16:09.989
Do you really think we can
stop an American invasion

01:16:09.991 --> 01:16:12.725
by shooting down one helicopter?

01:16:12.727 --> 01:16:14.760
I mean, of course, I knew
you guys were coming,

01:16:14.762 --> 01:16:17.029
but there was nothing
I could do to stop you,

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:21.000
so as a matter of fact, I was
getting ready to take a boat to Cuba,

01:16:21.002 --> 01:16:23.335
and suddenly, a
helicopter gets shot down,

01:16:23.337 --> 01:16:28.073
and everything stops
just like that,

01:16:28.075 --> 01:16:30.142
and the next morning,
I get a visit

01:16:30.144 --> 01:16:32.478
from one of my ex-patrons
telling me that

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:35.881
the next time the
helicopter would land

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:39.852
unless I signed off
some new oil leases,

01:16:39.854 --> 01:16:42.056
which of course I did.

01:16:45.459 --> 01:16:47.461
We were pawns.

01:16:49.263 --> 01:16:51.933
I am very sorry about
your friends, Mason.

01:16:57.838 --> 01:17:00.739
It's just crazy how
all this is going down

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:03.244
after you agree to do your
first interview in 10 years.

01:17:04.979 --> 01:17:07.913
Ah. That's why
you needed Claire.

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:09.915
You were gonna tell the truth
before they could take you out

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:12.153
and replace you with
somebody more user-friendly.

01:17:16.057 --> 01:17:17.856
We'll stop here for the night,

01:17:17.858 --> 01:17:21.229
and then, then we
end the charade.

01:17:57.865 --> 01:18:00.199
Brother, you are
killing me right now.

01:18:00.201 --> 01:18:01.800
I'm worried sick about you.

01:18:01.802 --> 01:18:03.235
Are you still with
Venegas? Yeah.

01:18:03.237 --> 01:18:05.237
I cut ties with
the South Africans.

01:18:05.239 --> 01:18:07.541
I'm gonna make this go away.

01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:12.511
Dude, we need to talk.

01:18:12.513 --> 01:18:14.113
Gracias. Sí.

01:18:14.115 --> 01:18:16.582
Gracias. De nada.

01:18:16.584 --> 01:18:18.917
Thanks.

01:18:18.919 --> 01:18:22.156
Mmm. Heh heh heh.

01:18:29.063 --> 01:18:31.098
So I agreed to trade
you for Claire.

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.100
Of course you did.

01:18:35.102 --> 01:18:37.303
Heh. Yeah, it's a...

01:18:37.305 --> 01:18:40.607
move I haven't totally
thought through, but...

01:18:40.609 --> 01:18:43.375
Hmm.

01:18:43.377 --> 01:18:45.077
May I please use your phone?

01:18:45.079 --> 01:18:47.279
For what?

01:18:47.281 --> 01:18:49.181
I am going to call
someone I trust.

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:51.417
Eduardo Lavato. Who's that?

01:18:51.419 --> 01:18:54.019
He's an old friend

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:57.923
and the shadow leader of
the opposition party, too.

01:18:57.925 --> 01:19:00.194
He's very resourceful.

01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:14.873
Mason, please, will
you sit down and enjoy

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:16.408
a cup of espresso with me?

01:19:16.410 --> 01:19:17.976
It's the best one
in Paldoñia, huh?

01:19:17.978 --> 01:19:19.646
This is a stupid idea.

01:19:19.648 --> 01:19:22.481
Gracias, amor.

01:19:22.483 --> 01:19:24.383
What is that saying?

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:25.584
Keep your friends close,

01:19:25.586 --> 01:19:27.319
keep your enemies closer.

01:19:27.321 --> 01:19:30.189
Yes it's from "The Go"...
it's from "The Godfather."

01:19:30.191 --> 01:19:34.328
America does produce some
wonderful culture, don't you agree?

01:19:54.415 --> 01:19:58.119
Papi. Ha ha ha!

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:01.880
- You're alive Papi!
- I am!

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.550
It's good to see you.

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:05.260
It was not my men
who attacked you.

01:20:05.285 --> 01:20:06.725
I know, I know.

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:08.670
- Espresso?
- Naturally.

01:20:10.158 --> 01:20:11.398
Who is this?

01:20:11.423 --> 01:20:14.233
This is my new American
friend Mason Pettits,

01:20:14.235 --> 01:20:16.268
and he's very worried about you.

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:18.205
An American friend? Mm-hmm.

01:20:19.974 --> 01:20:21.407
You really have hit bottom.

01:20:21.409 --> 01:20:23.544
Ah. Sit down. Sit down.

01:20:26.937 --> 01:20:28.404
Did you know we went

01:20:28.429 --> 01:20:31.063
to secondary school together?

01:20:31.152 --> 01:20:33.352
Jesuits. Jesuits.

01:20:33.354 --> 01:20:35.120
And I could tell you something.

01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:37.022
They did not let us
get away with anything.

01:20:37.024 --> 01:20:40.292
Nada. Hmm? Heh heh heh.

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:42.394
This is delicious.

01:20:42.396 --> 01:20:45.732
So do tell.

01:20:45.734 --> 01:20:48.133
What can the
People's Worker Party

01:20:48.135 --> 01:20:50.235
and/or The Armed
Revolutionary Front

01:20:50.237 --> 01:20:53.073
of Paldoñia do for you today?

01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:58.112
Just a petite favor, my friend.

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:08.320
So, uh, I got to ask.

01:21:08.322 --> 01:21:10.757
Why have an espresso
with a man who calls me

01:21:10.759 --> 01:21:12.692
a thief and a butcher
on a daily basis

01:21:12.694 --> 01:21:15.227
and every so often lets
off a bomb downtown?

01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:17.730
Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:17.732 --> 01:21:20.667
Well, perception is
reality, my friend.

01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:23.502
I pay Lavato and his resistance.

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:25.705
Every couple of months,
I let them blow up a car,

01:21:25.707 --> 01:21:28.775
burn down a building,
staging a caravan.

01:21:28.777 --> 01:21:32.511
It's like... it's like
a steam valve, you know?

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:34.546
Lets off pressure.

01:21:34.548 --> 01:21:37.249
Psssss.

01:21:37.251 --> 01:21:39.551
And then I crack down on
them so everybody knows

01:21:39.553 --> 01:21:42.421
they need Venegas
to give order, huh?

01:21:42.423 --> 01:21:44.156
Ha ha ha!

01:21:44.158 --> 01:21:45.457
My granduncle, he...

01:21:45.459 --> 01:21:46.585
Your granduncle you overthrew?

01:21:46.609 --> 01:21:48.260
Yes, that one. He
never understood this.

01:21:48.262 --> 01:21:49.824
Took everything personally.

01:21:49.849 --> 01:21:52.130
Of course, it backfired on him.

01:21:52.132 --> 01:21:53.467
So wait.

01:21:55.169 --> 01:21:57.236
So you... you bought
the revolution?

01:21:57.238 --> 01:21:59.538
Much simpler and
a lot of cheaper.

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.240
It's like you
Americans like to say,

01:22:01.242 --> 01:22:02.809
"A win-win."

01:22:02.811 --> 01:22:06.146
You should see
Eduardo's pool. Oh!

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.055
Keep her there.

01:22:51.793 --> 01:22:53.458
Colonel Koehorst?

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:55.294
Former South African SAS.

01:22:55.296 --> 01:22:57.229
Three-two Battalion.

01:22:57.231 --> 01:22:58.831
U.S. Army Special Forces?

01:22:58.833 --> 01:23:01.099
Me? I'm a lawyer.

01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:03.636
Sorry. All out of
business cards.

01:23:03.638 --> 01:23:05.237
Pretty brazen thing
you're doing here,

01:23:05.239 --> 01:23:06.438
taking over a sovereign nation.

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.240
Sovereign?

01:23:08.242 --> 01:23:09.742
When all's said and
done, no one's gonna have

01:23:09.744 --> 01:23:11.878
a problem with what
we're doing here.

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.512
The people of Paldoñia might.

01:23:13.514 --> 01:23:15.581
They won't know the difference.

01:23:15.583 --> 01:23:17.518
Status quo, my friend.

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:23.121
You should have done what was
expected, Sergeant Pettits.

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:26.124
Nah. I would have
never gotten near him.

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:27.894
You see, Venegas knew
it was going down.

01:23:27.896 --> 01:23:29.461
You'd be surprised what
that guy knows actually.

01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:31.864
Sharp dude, great dresser.

01:23:31.866 --> 01:23:33.735
Are we doing this then?

01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:37.772
Let's do it.

01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:44.378
Bring
the princess out of the car.

01:23:53.454 --> 01:23:55.320
Unh!

01:23:55.322 --> 01:23:56.756
Time for you
to hand over Venegas

01:23:56.758 --> 01:23:59.458
and piss off out of the country.

01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.493
If you don't do
that in 5 seconds,

01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:04.697
I'm going to kill your
client in front of you.

01:24:04.699 --> 01:24:05.898
1...

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:08.333
2, 3, 4...

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:11.604
OK. OK.

01:24:11.606 --> 01:24:13.173
OK!

01:24:52.379 --> 01:24:53.682
Unh!

01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:00.922
Move!

01:25:03.524 --> 01:25:06.959
Go, go, go! Aah!

01:25:06.961 --> 01:25:08.863
Get back!

01:25:25.446 --> 01:25:27.379
What was that?

01:25:27.381 --> 01:25:30.449
That was my people, Claire, huh?

01:25:30.451 --> 01:25:32.885
Now I give my people a message,

01:25:32.887 --> 01:25:34.754
and you share it with the world.

01:25:34.756 --> 01:25:36.131
Great. Let's get started.

01:25:36.156 --> 01:25:37.724
I... I can live feed it
through Infamous Daily.

01:25:37.726 --> 01:25:38.733
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:25:38.758 --> 01:25:41.279
I cannot deliver such an
important message from here.

01:25:41.304 --> 01:25:42.405
We have to do it from my palace

01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:43.829
with my nephew by my side.

01:25:43.865 --> 01:25:45.303
Come on. What,
do we just go up

01:25:45.328 --> 01:25:47.701
and knock on the
front door? No.

01:25:48.335 --> 01:25:50.237
There is another way.

01:25:51.673 --> 01:25:55.708
Oh. Watch your head there, OK?

01:25:55.710 --> 01:25:57.409
This is the tunnel
I used to escape

01:25:57.411 --> 01:25:59.045
when they tried to
kill me 8 years ago.

01:25:59.047 --> 01:26:00.813
Are you sure this
tunnel isn't guarded?

01:26:00.815 --> 01:26:02.037
Absolutely!

01:26:02.062 --> 01:26:04.428
All the people who know
about it are dead now.

01:26:04.453 --> 01:26:06.268
What about the other times
they tried to kill you?

01:26:06.292 --> 01:26:08.920
Oh, that's different
dead people.

01:26:09.289 --> 01:26:10.792
Let's go.

01:26:35.650 --> 01:26:37.884
Hey. Aah! Ohh!

01:26:37.886 --> 01:26:39.389
No, no. Uncle!

01:26:39.414 --> 01:26:41.453
OK. Hey, hey, hey. Thank you.

01:26:41.455 --> 01:26:43.956
No, thank you. I am
not here to hurt you.

01:26:43.958 --> 01:26:46.025
It's OK.

01:26:46.027 --> 01:26:48.460
These are my American friends.

01:26:48.462 --> 01:26:50.595
They are here to help.

01:26:50.597 --> 01:26:52.665
What is this woman doing?

01:26:52.667 --> 01:26:54.967
I'm live streaming this
to the entire world.

01:26:54.969 --> 01:26:57.335
Listen to me.

01:26:57.337 --> 01:26:59.471
When you are no
longer useful to them,

01:26:59.473 --> 01:27:01.540
they are going to kill you.

01:27:01.542 --> 01:27:03.408
Paldoñia deserves
a better future,

01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:06.612
not one controlled
by corporations.

01:27:06.614 --> 01:27:11.385
We... we don't have to
be monsters anymore.

01:27:17.058 --> 01:27:19.859
Yes. Yes.

01:27:19.861 --> 01:27:22.462
Yes. Yes.

01:27:24.632 --> 01:27:26.935
You've always been my favorite.

01:27:29.737 --> 01:27:31.704
General Martínez.

01:27:31.706 --> 01:27:34.573
El Presidente. Mr. President.

01:27:34.575 --> 01:27:36.553
Alive and kicking!

01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:39.262
So I see.

01:27:42.784 --> 01:27:44.549
Ohh!

01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:46.420
Aah! Aah!

01:27:51.425 --> 01:27:52.792
You good?

01:27:52.794 --> 01:27:54.492
Yeah.

01:28:00.668 --> 01:28:03.501
Yeah. I'm OK. I'm OK. I'm OK.

01:28:03.503 --> 01:28:05.104
Look. Look.

01:28:05.106 --> 01:28:08.941
Ahh. Heh. Ha ha!

01:28:08.943 --> 01:28:11.509
Bulletproof suit from Medici.

01:28:11.511 --> 01:28:12.845
Ha ha ha! Huh?

01:28:12.847 --> 01:28:14.436
I should have one made for you.

01:28:16.117 --> 01:28:18.516
Jorge. Jorge.

01:28:20.021 --> 01:28:21.923
Jorge. Jorge.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.420
You're okay! You're okay!

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:24.720
You're okay!

01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:29.670
Uncle...

01:28:32.466 --> 01:28:33.799
Shh.

01:28:33.801 --> 01:28:35.803
Uncle...

01:28:35.853 --> 01:28:37.813
They killed... me.

01:28:37.838 --> 01:28:41.264
Shh. Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

01:28:41.289 --> 01:28:42.920
I'm s... I'm sorry.

01:29:19.524 --> 01:29:20.734
Surrender!

01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:23.860
Soldiers!

01:29:24.294 --> 01:29:26.957
I know you are obeying orders.

01:29:27.949 --> 01:29:29.409
My children...

01:29:30.170 --> 01:29:32.380
You don't have to do this.

01:29:33.466 --> 01:29:35.386
My brothers.

01:29:35.610 --> 01:29:39.160
You can change the
destiny of this country.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.330
Not for me.

01:29:41.857 --> 01:29:43.651
But for you.

01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.420
For your mothers.

01:29:47.869 --> 01:29:49.709
For your fathers.

01:29:50.973 --> 01:29:53.063
For your children.

01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:56.262
This country has
bled for too long.

01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:58.930
This madness has to end.

01:30:04.811 --> 01:30:06.245
Oh, shit.

01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:08.150
Now is the time to fight...

01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:12.030
Fight... for this land.

01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:17.700
My brothers.

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:19.250
Defend

01:30:19.411 --> 01:30:21.121
your homeland.

01:30:25.003 --> 01:30:26.872
Go!

01:30:40.328 --> 01:30:42.030
Take cover!

01:30:44.866 --> 01:30:46.634
Suppressing fire!

01:30:50.638 --> 01:30:52.805
Go! Go for Paldoñia!

01:30:52.807 --> 01:30:55.573
Hey! Not the time
for coaching.

01:30:55.575 --> 01:30:57.078
Fuck, man! Oh!

01:31:05.853 --> 01:31:07.620
Spielberg, what the
hell are you doing?

01:31:07.622 --> 01:31:08.954
What? Stay down!

01:31:08.956 --> 01:31:09.991
Fine!

01:31:14.028 --> 01:31:16.796
Take the tunnel, OK?
Hold on. Hold on.

01:31:16.798 --> 01:31:20.935
Ready? Go, go, go, go, go!

01:31:27.942 --> 01:31:29.075
Follow me! Follow me!

01:31:29.077 --> 01:31:30.876
Mason?

01:31:33.081 --> 01:31:35.281
Go, go!

01:31:35.283 --> 01:31:38.186
You've been hit. I'm fine! Go!

01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:41.956
Aah!

01:31:45.193 --> 01:31:47.462
See? I'm fine.

01:31:51.299 --> 01:31:52.998
Come in. We're safe here.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.334
This is my man cave.

01:31:55.336 --> 01:31:58.003
Oh. You care for a drink?

01:31:58.005 --> 01:31:59.738
Yeah. I always
love a single malt

01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:02.243
after I kneecap a
few mercenaries.

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.114
Come on, Mason.
Embrace the suck.

01:32:08.116 --> 01:32:09.851
Nnn, nnn, nnn.

01:32:11.953 --> 01:32:13.387
Uh-oh.

01:32:28.336 --> 01:32:33.405
Hmm. Ah! Yes.

01:32:33.407 --> 01:32:36.043
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:32:42.183 --> 01:32:43.918
This way. Come on.

01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:51.060
Mr. Venegas?

01:32:53.770 --> 01:32:55.690
Mr. President?

01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:57.610
Yes...

01:32:58.099 --> 01:32:59.298
Go! Aah!

01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:01.333
Go, go, go!

01:33:01.335 --> 01:33:03.371
Go, go, go!

01:33:09.277 --> 01:33:12.346
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:33:17.752 --> 01:33:18.951
That way. That way.

01:33:18.953 --> 01:33:20.819
We have to go that way.

01:33:20.821 --> 01:33:22.190
Aah!

01:33:31.332 --> 01:33:33.034
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:34:12.306 --> 01:34:13.774
Agh!

01:34:20.081 --> 01:34:22.149
Get down. OK.

01:34:28.823 --> 01:34:30.124
Aah!

01:35:01.522 --> 01:35:03.645
Let's go! Let's go! OK.

01:35:03.972 --> 01:35:05.674
Ready? Aah!

01:35:24.578 --> 01:35:26.434
Errgh!

01:35:29.531 --> 01:35:31.598
Say hello to your mates for me.

01:35:32.055 --> 01:35:34.614
Shame it took so long
to finish the job.

01:35:35.122 --> 01:35:38.357
You... you killed my friends.

01:35:38.359 --> 01:35:40.192
There were 7 of us.

01:35:40.194 --> 01:35:42.512
RPGs aren't that easy to aim.

01:35:42.566 --> 01:35:45.002
It's just a job, my friend.

01:35:50.061 --> 01:35:51.293
Unh!

01:35:54.342 --> 01:35:55.646
Hey.

01:35:55.976 --> 01:35:57.176
Where'd you learn that?

01:35:57.178 --> 01:35:58.410
The throat thing?

01:35:58.412 --> 01:36:00.412
Thank my dad for that.

01:36:00.414 --> 01:36:02.181
I told you I could help.

01:36:04.552 --> 01:36:05.966
Let's go.

01:36:15.896 --> 01:36:19.266
Mason! I could really
use your help right now.

01:36:22.203 --> 01:36:23.437
Shit!

01:36:28.242 --> 01:36:29.944
Shit! Oh, my God.

01:36:47.962 --> 01:36:49.430
Aah! Aah!

01:36:58.078 --> 01:36:59.232
What?

01:36:59.257 --> 01:37:00.154
Oh, oh. Nothing.

01:37:00.179 --> 01:37:01.746
Keep shooting them. OK.

01:37:13.354 --> 01:37:15.169
Come on! Let's go!

01:37:16.094 --> 01:37:17.496
On me!

01:37:19.537 --> 01:37:21.270
Down the hall!

01:37:21.429 --> 01:37:23.228
Hey, bro!

01:37:23.230 --> 01:37:25.230
Ha ha! Chicks Dig It!

01:37:25.232 --> 01:37:26.633
Huh? Huh?

01:37:26.635 --> 01:37:28.569
It's an inside joke.

01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:31.638
Go! Go! Go!

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:33.240
Take cover!

01:37:34.442 --> 01:37:36.043
Come on!

01:37:38.145 --> 01:37:39.378
Yes! Unh!

01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:40.446
Sorry I'm late, brother.

01:37:40.448 --> 01:37:42.049
You kidding me?

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:47.286
Never thought I'd say this,

01:37:47.288 --> 01:37:49.188
but I'd like to introduce you

01:37:49.190 --> 01:37:51.630
to President Venegas.

01:37:52.126 --> 01:37:54.161
Welcome to Paldoñia.

01:37:54.186 --> 01:37:55.765
Nice to meet you...

01:37:56.127 --> 01:37:57.597
I think.

01:38:01.469 --> 01:38:03.003
Oh!

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.997
Retreat!

01:38:12.111 --> 01:38:14.579
The eyes of the world
are still fixed on Paldoñia,

01:38:14.604 --> 01:38:18.071
where the fallout from a failed
coup continues to play out.

01:38:18.096 --> 01:38:20.196
In a bold act of
guerrilla journalism,

01:38:20.254 --> 01:38:23.255
using a live stream through
gossip site Infamous Daily,

01:38:23.257 --> 01:38:25.758
celebrity reporter Claire
Wellington provided

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:29.044
on-the-ground coverage
of these shocking events.

01:38:29.069 --> 01:38:32.070
The Paldoñian military were
seen in an intense gun battle

01:38:32.095 --> 01:38:34.066
with members of what
we now know to be

01:38:34.068 --> 01:38:36.068
a private military company.

01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:38.170
Ms. Wellington has also uploaded

01:38:38.172 --> 01:38:41.406
an exclusive uncut interview
with President Venegas,

01:38:41.408 --> 01:38:43.308
announcing a surprising reversal

01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:46.313
in the Paldoñian
system of government.

01:38:49.316 --> 01:38:50.661
I know as a journalist

01:38:50.686 --> 01:38:52.045
I'm supposed to stay
objective and all,

01:38:52.069 --> 01:38:55.617
but I have to say I really
admire what you're doing.

01:38:55.642 --> 01:38:57.541
Well, you know what they say.

01:38:57.566 --> 01:39:01.036
The man who touches
honey will eventually...

01:39:02.406 --> 01:39:04.106
lick his fingers.

01:39:04.131 --> 01:39:06.532
Oh. Hmm.

01:39:06.716 --> 01:39:08.567
Ha ha!

01:39:08.569 --> 01:39:11.069
I really appreciate you two.

01:39:11.071 --> 01:39:12.458
I really do.

01:39:13.675 --> 01:39:17.919
And look. The world
is finally seeing us,

01:39:17.944 --> 01:39:20.878
and it is all because
of you, Miss Wellington.

01:39:21.181 --> 01:39:23.248
Looks like your
tattoo was right.

01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:25.250
Everything worked out just fine.

01:39:25.252 --> 01:39:27.720
Worked out fine, thanks to you.

01:39:27.722 --> 01:39:29.321
Team effort. Yes!

01:39:29.323 --> 01:39:30.690
The right people
at the right time.

01:39:30.692 --> 01:39:32.021
Yeah.

01:39:32.827 --> 01:39:34.526
Let's go tell a
story to the world.

01:39:34.528 --> 01:39:35.810
I will follow your lead.

01:39:35.835 --> 01:39:39.169
Hold up just one
second just so I know.

01:39:39.466 --> 01:39:41.734
How many people in this room
want to kill you right now?

01:39:41.736 --> 01:39:43.638
Eh, probably half.

01:39:45.472 --> 01:39:48.641
No, more than half. Ha ha ha!

01:39:48.643 --> 01:39:50.877
Ah. Let's go. Come on.

01:39:50.879 --> 01:39:53.278
Uh...

01:39:57.619 --> 01:39:59.686
Welcome.

01:39:59.688 --> 01:40:04.624
As of today, I am no longer
the president of Paldoñia.

01:40:04.626 --> 01:40:07.225
A transitional government
has been put in place

01:40:07.227 --> 01:40:09.161
until the next free elections.

01:40:09.163 --> 01:40:13.131
During this transitional period,
$5 billion will be invested

01:40:13.133 --> 01:40:16.468
in health, education,
and infrastructure.

01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:19.438
This is an investment in
the people of Paldoñia.

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:23.776
Today, you get back what
is rightfully yours,

01:40:23.778 --> 01:40:27.245
and for the years to
come, we'll protect

01:40:27.247 --> 01:40:31.784
and control these resources
with the sole purpose...

01:40:31.786 --> 01:40:33.013
Mason.

01:40:33.038 --> 01:40:34.700
Of giving this
beautiful nation...

01:40:34.725 --> 01:40:38.194
Like, uh, dancing when
he's, like, not fluent.

01:40:38.693 --> 01:40:41.935
He's literally...

01:40:41.974 --> 01:40:45.142
That's only because you know...

01:40:48.737 --> 01:40:51.938
Anyway, I want to teach...

01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:53.146
Daddy!

01:40:53.171 --> 01:40:55.706
Hey, Worm. Ha ha ha!

01:40:55.745 --> 01:40:58.466
Aww! Ahh!

01:40:58.565 --> 01:41:01.267
And check this out.

01:41:02.717 --> 01:41:04.284
Boom.

01:41:06.587 --> 01:41:08.755
What happened to your face?

01:41:08.757 --> 01:41:10.657
It's a long story.

01:41:10.659 --> 01:41:13.227
Oh, baby. Here I am.

01:41:16.530 --> 01:41:18.465
In one piece.

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.702
Just so you know,
that broken man

01:41:22.704 --> 01:41:23.970
you wanted a divorce,
he disappeared somewhere

01:41:23.972 --> 01:41:25.122
in South America.

01:41:25.147 --> 01:41:26.714
Ha ha ha!

01:41:28.710 --> 01:41:30.575
I was really hoping
you'd reconsider.

01:41:30.577 --> 01:41:33.411
Ah, you know what?

01:41:33.678 --> 01:41:36.247
I think I'm gonna have
to consult my lawyer.

01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:41.652
Oh, Mason.

01:42:01.743 --> 01:42:05.446
I'm just gonna make
a... quick stop.

01:42:15.924 --> 01:42:17.524
Shit.

01:42:34.441 --> 01:42:36.508
Yes! What? Huh?

01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:38.611
Mason, voice-over:
And just like that,

01:42:38.613 --> 01:42:41.279
I saw an incredible
life of minivans,

01:42:41.281 --> 01:42:43.582
play dates, and amusement parks,

01:42:43.584 --> 01:42:46.953
and for the first time in my
entire overachieving life...

01:42:46.955 --> 01:42:48.553
No! That dance.

01:42:48.555 --> 01:42:49.991
Mason, voice-over: I was happy.

01:42:52.326 --> 01:42:55.327
What's up?

01:42:55.329 --> 01:42:56.863
What do you say we
just take the rest

01:42:56.865 --> 01:42:58.631
of the day off and spend
it with the family?

01:42:58.633 --> 01:43:00.465
Yeah! Yeah, you like that?

01:43:00.467 --> 01:43:01.533
Yeah. Let's do it.

01:43:01.535 --> 01:43:02.601
You're so cute. Why?

01:43:02.603 --> 01:43:04.637
Uh, well, um...

01:43:04.639 --> 01:43:06.040
Mason, voice-over:
I had purpose.

01:43:18.318 --> 01:43:19.919
He says he doesn't
know that I know.

01:43:19.921 --> 01:43:21.419
I think he does know.

01:43:21.421 --> 01:43:22.722
He was there, and
then we came out,

01:43:22.724 --> 01:43:24.422
and he was, like,
just dick staring,

01:43:24.424 --> 01:43:25.858
and it was, like, weird
because, you know, like,

01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:27.392
you only have 2
seconds, 5... 5 tops...

01:43:27.394 --> 01:43:29.528
Well, because it's...
it's impressive.

01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:31.063
To stare at a guy's dick.

01:43:31.065 --> 01:43:32.865
You look at that, it is
like a beast of its own.

01:43:32.867 --> 01:43:34.466
He... it was, like...
I'm telling you it was...

01:43:34.468 --> 01:43:35.600
It's a snake. It's a monster.

01:43:35.602 --> 01:43:37.103
8 Mississippi.

01:43:37.105 --> 01:43:39.972
Yeah, it's... yeah.
All right. What else?

01:43:39.974 --> 01:43:41.874
Are you a serious
journalist for sure?

01:43:41.876 --> 01:43:43.609
I am for sure a
serious journalist,

01:43:43.611 --> 01:43:45.611
and I would like you
to take me seriously.

01:43:45.613 --> 01:43:47.713
I don't understand why...

01:43:47.715 --> 01:43:48.881
I think... I think I can do
that after what just happened.

01:43:48.883 --> 01:43:50.917
You're not. No, that's fair.

01:43:50.919 --> 01:43:52.652
Yeah.

01:44:03.131 --> 01:44:04.864
2-5 seconds max, dude.

01:44:04.866 --> 01:44:06.632
I am still very sorry.

01:44:06.634 --> 01:44:07.967
I didn't know you felt
this way, but we can...

01:44:07.969 --> 01:44:09.802
Those are... those
are unwritten rules

01:44:09.804 --> 01:44:11.704
on the walls of every YMCA.

01:44:11.706 --> 01:44:13.505
There are rooms up there, We
can... we can take this...

01:44:13.507 --> 01:44:15.507
Every fucking YMCA has something

01:44:15.509 --> 01:44:17.977
in the bathroom about 5
seconds dick staring max.

01:44:17.979 --> 01:44:19.078
Really? Yeah, man.

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.648
Welcome to America.
