1
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,375
From time immemorial,

2
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,458
the ancient Ukrainian forest

3
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,791
has harboured amazing secrets
and mysteries.

4
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,625
Behind the Dark Mountain,

5
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,250
in the forest's heart,

6
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,541
the Source of Life is hidden.

7
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,916
It provides the forest
and its dwellers

8
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,750
with their power, their spark.

9
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,291
But one winter,

10
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,166
while the forest
was fast asleep,

11
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,791
with the guardian alone
watching over it,

12
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,083
a human broke into the forest

13
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,375
through the passage
in the Dark Mountain.

14
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:21,208
It was the owner of the sawmill.

15
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,416
He needed at least one drop
from the Source of Life

16
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,458
to save his dying
newborn daughter.

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,875
But then he returned
and brought an army with him,

18
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:36,458
hoping to take over
the entire Source for himself.

19
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,833
And so a terrible battle began

20
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,458
that left no winners.

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,750
Only losers.

22
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,291
All humans who had trespassed

23
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,166
behind the Dark Mountain
vanished.

24
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,208
The Forest Guardian

25
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,458
lost all but an echo
of his ancient strength.

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,375
And when the forest creatures
woke in the spring,

27
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,750
they were greeted by
the horrific consequences

28
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,625
of the humans' treachery.

29
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:10,041
Look at what
our enemies have done.

30
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,083
For this reason,

31
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,000
no human shall set foot

32
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,666
behind the Dark Mountain
ever again!

33
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,916
This is the new forest law.

34
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:28,166
Many years have passed
since that day.

35
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,708
Another winter is over.

36
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,708
Oh, I've slept so long.

37
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,708
I was having
the loveliest dream.

38
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,666
But this is better
than any dream.

39
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:24,166
It's finally spring.

40
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,375
Swampy!

41
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,416
It's the best part
of the best day of the year.

42
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,875
Time to wake up the forest.

43
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:27,583
Hark! Hush, the master
of sounds, approaches.

44
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,791
Happy spring, Mavka!

45
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,583
Hush! You can fly?!

46
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,208
That's kind of huge news.

47
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,416
They'll call me Hush,
who conquered the sky!

48
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,166
Just don't tell Lesh.

49
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,750
He'll think
I'm stork-raving mad.

50
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,500
Whoa!

51
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,125
Yeah! One more! More!

52
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,250
And the fans go wild!

53
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,208
We are so ready
to conquer the world.

54
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,250
Settle down, kid.
Hometown crowd.

55
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,000
Everybody knows us here.

56
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,333
Wow, I'm just so nervous.

57
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,125
What if things don't work out
in the city?

58
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,041
There are so many
other musicians there.

59
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,125
You have to believe
in yourself, Nina,

60
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,125
and let the music
show us the way.

61
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,041
Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

62
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,166
What was that?

63
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,291
"Big money
for an important job?"

64
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,583
Hm, not for a soon-to-be
musical legend like me.

65
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,791
But maybe Uncle Leo
can use this.

66
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,250
Lucas, your uncle,

67
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,083
he's not feeling well.

68
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,083
They called the healer
and everything.

69
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,083
Get home, quick.

70
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,875
Hopefully we'll see you
at the fair later.

71
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,166
-Hey, look!
-What is it?

72
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,875
Greetings,

73
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:19,333
after so long,
my dear fellow villagers.

74
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,500
It is I, Kylina,

75
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:25,916
the daughter and only heiress
of the late sawmill owner.

76
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,541
The one that got burned up
by forest demons?

77
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,750
Yes, my father died tragically

78
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,166
in a forest wildfire,

79
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,875
but it had nothing to do
with your quaint superstitions.

80
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:42,750
After dear Daddy's death,
my mother and I left this place,

81
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,041
but soon I became an orphan.

82
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,958
-Oh, poor thing. What a shame.

83
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,208
How positively tragic!

84
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:57,833
But now I am back to make
our village prosperous again.

85
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,708
I'm offering you all a job.

86
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,458
You'll have so much money

87
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,916
that you'll never
have to work again.

88
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,000
Not working is my dream job.

89
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,458
I'll rebuild the sawmill.

90
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,916
We'll start selling our timber
all around the world.

91
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,291
Aren't you all good and ready
to become rich and happy?

92
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,375
-Yeah!
-Absolutely.

93
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,291
-Yes!
-What do you want us to do?

94
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,250
All you have to do is pop over
the Dark Mountain...

95
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,625
What?

96
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,416
Oh, she's cuckoo.

97
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,958
Ugh, just like her father.

98
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,750
But I'm talking huge money.

99
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,166
You can't buy another life.

100
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,583
Tell the evil spirits I said hi.

101
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,916
-What's that?

102
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,083
Easy, easy.

103
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,583
What's the matter?

104
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,875
A trap!

105
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,750
Probably left
from the old times.

106
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,333
Huh?

107
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,708
Huh?

108
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,000
The guardian is calling us.

109
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,208
Uh, how is he?

110
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,416
He's holding on, but my herbs
can only do so much.

111
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,708
Leo needs real medicine
from the city.

112
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,666
But...it's not going
to be cheap.

113
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,041
Uh...

114
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,166
"Per-du-cabri-co-carum"?

115
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,291
Just give this to the pharmacist
in the city.

116
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,875
He'll understand.

117
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,875
Thank you. Sincerely.

118
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,041
Great news, Uncle.

119
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,958
A little perdi-caca-something-um

120
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,166
and you'll be good as new.

121
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:42,458
Lucas, what are you doing?

122
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,583
You can't waste
your money on me.

123
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:49,166
I'm old and I've had
a good long run.

124
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:56,625
Spend it on a nice girl,
get settled down...

125
00:11:56,666 --> 00:12:00,541
..so your old uncle
can die in peace.

126
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,000
Nobody's going to D-word.

127
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,958
I'll find the money
some...where.

128
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,375
Uncle, you'll be fine.
I've got you.

129
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,583
-I've got you!

130
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,625
Oh, madam,
it's your family mansion.

131
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,708
How...rustic.

132
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,041
Ugh, it's just
a revolting hovel.

133
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,250
A bunch of pathetic cowards!

134
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,666
All my plans are at risk

135
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,500
just because this primitive mob
is terrified by the forest.

136
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,708
-Move it, Frol!

137
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,375
Oh, ma'am. Right away.
Just a second.

138
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:59,833
Do me a favour and get
these peasant rags off me.

139
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,833
How can they wear
this hideous stuff?!

140
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,166
Ugh, I hate it.
Get rid of it right away.

141
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:10,041
What a terrible piece
of tasteless trash.

142
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,958
Stupid, uneducated,
superstitious mob.

143
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,375
-Frol!
-Oh, my God.

144
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,875
This is so old-fashioned.

145
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,708
Don't get me upset, Frol.

146
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,500
It's bad for my complexion.

147
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,666
Oh, sure, madam.

148
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,250
-Oh!

149
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,041
Clumsy idiots!

150
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,125
Inside this case is...

151
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,958
Just be careful with it.

152
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,791
Mm?

153
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,166
What is it?

154
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,750
Uh, about this job offer...

155
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,041
Oh, forget it.

156
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,458
Who's there?

157
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,916
Frol!

158
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,583
Oh, about THAT job offer?

159
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,041
Please come in.

160
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,708
Hi. My name's Lucas.

161
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,291
It says you'll pay well.

162
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,666
Hmm.

163
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,333
Hmm.

164
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,375
I will.

165
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,208
If you're up to it.

166
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,541
Uh, I am.

167
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,125
I can do any job.

168
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,375
Good.

169
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,375
Eric, Derek, you go with him.

170
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,833
So...what do I have to do?

171
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,125
Find me the tree with this leaf.

172
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,750
Uh... Huh!

173
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,166
In the forest
behind the Dark Mountain.

174
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,166
Hmm.

175
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,791
FOREST-DWELLER: What happened?

176
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,833
The guardian
is summoning everybody?

177
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,958
This hasn't happened
since I was a sapling.

178
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,750
-I'd rather take a nap.
-The guardian?!

179
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,708
Greetings upon the new spring,

180
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,958
my fellow forest-dwellers.

181
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,958
Is everyone here?

182
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,666
Mavka, did you wake
everybody up?

183
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,916
She's probably frolicking

184
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,791
through the crocuses
with Swampy again.

185
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,458
-I'm sorry I'm late, Guardian.

186
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,083
I was helping the lynx cub
get out of an old trap.

187
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,000
-How terrible!
-An old trap.

188
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,500
I thought they were
all removed after the battle?

189
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,166
Nymphs.

190
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,416
You are
the forest's armed forces.

191
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,208
Which one of you missed this?

192
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,916
Good job, Mavka.

193
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,208
You've embarrassed us
in front of the guardian.

194
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,166
Now, then,

195
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,125
listen, forest-dwellers.

196
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,166
The Supreme Spirits of Nature

197
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:32,541
whisper that dangerous times
approach.

198
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:36,208
Therefore, at midnight tonight,

199
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,375
in the heart of the forest,

200
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:43,500
the spirits shall choose
a new guardian.

201
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,666
Lesh, but what about you?

202
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,625
I have so little strength left.

203
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,625
The guardian's burden

204
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,625
has grown too heavy for me.

205
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,583
Lesh won't be
the guardian anymore?

206
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,583
Will the humans attack us again?

207
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:04,125
-Who else can protect us?
Hark.

208
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:08,208
Hush the sky conqueror
can become the guardian.

209
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,583
Guardian chatterbox?

210
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,625
Yeah, just what we need.

211
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,625
I heard that.

212
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,750
But really, anyone
can become the guardian.

213
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,833
You mean like even you?

214
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,583
No, no, no, Mavka.

215
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,708
You may be the sweet,
pure soul of the forest,

216
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,416
but for this job
you are just way too nice.

217
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,791
No, I'm not.

218
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,416
Ooh. I feel unwell.

219
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,000
Ondina, are you alright?

220
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,333
See? So gullible and nice!

221
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,958
Enough!

222
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,291
All will be decided at midnight

223
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,291
in the heart of the forest.

224
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,666
People say that
behind the Dark Mountain,

225
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,750
the water nymphs and tree
spirits can tickle you to death.

226
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,833
Uh, you're laughing and laughing

227
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,083
and then bleugh!

228
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,666
We don't believe in monsters
of the forest.

229
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,375
Where do we go from here?

230
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,875
I think through this way.

231
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,791
Uh...

232
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,500
Uh-huh.

233
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,625
I didn't think we came here
to hunt.

234
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,208
This isn't hunting.

235
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,125
This is fun.

236
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,083
-Yeah.

237
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,625
Impossible.

238
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,875
Today of all days.

239
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,583
It was an accident. I tripped.

240
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,958
I am extremely clumsy.

241
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,875
My childhood nickname was
Clumsy Lucas.

242
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,833
We'll make you
Clumsy Black-and-Blue-cus.

243
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,208
Mm-hm.

244
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,083
My brother thinks
you should go on by yourself.

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,500
If you find the tree,
mark it on the map.

246
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,375
OK.

247
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,083
I was gonna suggest that anyway.

248
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,125
I feel their fear.

249
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,916
Quiet down.

250
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,750
Everything is fine now.

251
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,291
What scared you so much?

252
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,875
Humans? Here?

253
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,750
I have to tell the nymphs.

254
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,208
Wait.

255
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,916
Come on, Swampy.

256
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,958
I'll deal
with the humans myself.

257
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,750
Let's show them how 'nice' I am.

258
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,791
Argh!

259
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,916
Where in the haunted heck
is this tree?

260
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,291
Believe in yourself, Lucas.

261
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,250
Let the music show you the way.

262
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,166
Whatever that means.

263
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,125
Ohh!

264
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,375
It's so beautiful.

265
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,416
Oh, thanks. I...

266
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,125
Uhh...

267
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,916
Argh!

268
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,000
-Argh!

269
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,083
Forest demon!

270
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,333
Argh!

271
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,291
Is the human dead?

272
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:38,875
Is this some sort
of human magic?

273
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,041
Mavka!

274
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,916
A lot of weird, whistly,
raspy sounds

275
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,416
coming from this exact area
and I...

276
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,416
-Uh, Hush.

277
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,875
You already learned
how to dismount the stork.

278
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,333
Nice.

279
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,458
I am on high alert.

280
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,666
Our forest has just been
incursion-ated by...

281
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,583
Argh! THE HUMANS!

282
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,750
I'll watch him.
You go get the nymphs.

283
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:03,875
Oh, no.

284
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,625
I say we can drive the human

285
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,375
out of the forest on our own.

286
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:10,458
So I would be Hush, the first
kicker-outer of humans?

287
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,333
Oh, I like that very much.

288
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,208
-Argh!

289
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,250
Uh... Argh! Evil spirits.

290
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,500
Keep back, I'm warning you.

291
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:30,083
I... I'm a...borscht belt
in combat polka.

292
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,500
Pathetic little human!

293
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,041
You violated
our sacred forest...

294
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,291
Huh?!

295
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,833
..and tried to harm
these noble bison.

296
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,875
No! Super no.

297
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,875
That was the bouncer brothers.

298
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:44,208
In fact, I saved
the bison from them!

299
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,000
What is this, then?

300
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:47,833
Oh. That's my flute.

301
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:50,541
I, uh, play my music on it...
with it.

302
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,708
'Music'?

303
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,625
And you were doing this

304
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,583
to try and magically
enchant me in some way?

305
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,791
No! Well, sure.

306
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,791
Music is kind of magic, but...

307
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,458
Wait, so you liked it, then?

308
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,916
You do not question me,
little human!

309
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,833
Why have you trespassed here?

310
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:12,916
A strange lady offered me a big
reward to find a special leaf.

311
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,916
Aha! You hear that? A reward!

312
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:18,333
I knew that all humans
were selfish and greedy!

313
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,250
-Why you little...

314
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:22,500
-Ouch.

315
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:33,750
You see this!
Human treachery!

316
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:37,875
Huh?

317
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,291
Wow!

318
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,583
You are the most amazingly
beautiful demon

319
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,041
I have ever seen.

320
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,833
Your eyes.

321
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,291
I am not a demon.

322
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,791
I am Mavka,
the soul of the forest.

323
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:57,125
Well, I'm Lucas.

324
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:00,166
The soul of...myself?

325
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:03,375
Look, I can explain.

326
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:06,416
I need that reward to buy
medicine for my uncle Leo.

327
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:10,333
No. I have been warned that
humans are skilful liars.

328
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:14,125
You have broken the law
of the forest and I expel you!

329
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:17,791
No expulsion necessary.
I'll leave myself.

330
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:20,333
Just let me find
this silly leaf first

331
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,000
or else my uncle...

332
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,041
..dies.

333
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,833
How awful. I'm so sorry.

334
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,041
-Whargh!

335
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:31,458
Hey there, little...

336
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,041
What are you?

337
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,375
This is Swampy,
the last of the kittyfrogs.

338
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,875
Awww!

339
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:39,708
It's so cute how much
he hates me.

340
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,875
-Oh!

341
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:42,791
You want something super yummy?

342
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,791
Had a feeling you'd like that.

343
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:53,750
You're very different
from the evil humans

344
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:56,166
in all the forest legends.

345
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,333
-Huh?

346
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:42,750
Huh?

347
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,833
Derek, hold my boomstick.

348
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,583
Derek?

349
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,916
Derek? Where are you?

350
00:27:57,916 --> 00:28:00,250
I'll teach you,
you filthy human!

351
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:01,875
Hush, what are you doing?

352
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,125
Swampy, spit it out immediately!

353
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:07,541
This grotty fleshbag
is trying to poison you.

354
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,500
Hey! It's my mother's recipe.

355
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:11,750
Oh, Mommy
poisons folks too, huh?

356
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,166
Hush, stop!

357
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,000
Lucas, leave him alone.

358
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:22,000
-Huh?
-You gave it a name already?

359
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:28,458
Lucas. Stop it right now!

360
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:35,875
Well, he started it.
He has to leave.

361
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,416
I need the leaf.

362
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,708
Fine, here's a leaf. Now leave.

363
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,125
Not this one.

364
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,875
Are all humans this picky?

365
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:45,708
Lucas. It's not the leaves
you really need.

366
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,541
You need to heal your uncle

367
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,875
and I'll give you
the cure he needs.

368
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:51,166
Really?!

369
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:53,916
Oh, thank you. You are so nice.

370
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,291
Hey, hey, hey.

371
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,791
Do you really want
to break the law

372
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:59,333
to help a human on such a day?

373
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,041
You heard him.

374
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:02,875
He saved the bison,

375
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:06,416
and for some reason...
I believe him.

376
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,250
-Urgh!

377
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:11,625
After all,
the soul of the forest

378
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,583
must help all the living
creatures in the forest, right?

379
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:17,250
And Lucas is a living creature
who is in the forest.

380
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:19,000
-Huh?
-Therefore, I have to help him.

381
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:21,625
And you will help me help him.

382
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,083
Me?

383
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:24,500
No way! Never!

384
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:26,583
Never, never, never, never,
never, never, never!

385
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,541
-No!

386
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:33,291
When will I learn that I'm
incapable of saying no to you?

387
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:37,500
Don't worry, Hush. We'll make it
before the ceremony starts.

388
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:40,208
I'll give Lucas the cure
for his uncle and...

389
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,625
And then he'll leave
the forest forever.

390
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,583
I promise.

391
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:49,000
Hmm?

392
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:51,791
Come to me!

393
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:56,250
Don't be shy. Come closer.

394
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,083
Ahhh!

395
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:13,500
Huh?

396
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,791
Argh!

397
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,875
How did I...

398
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:24,541
Curses!

399
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,125
-Uh...

400
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,500
Oh.

401
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,458
Mm.

402
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,041
Huh?

403
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,208
Mavka, how can I thank you
for your help?

404
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,083
Just tell me and I'll do it
with pleasure.

405
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:51,500
Maybe you could play
your music for me?

406
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,250
Oh. Sure thing.

407
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,708
No, no, no, not now.

408
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,000
Nobody can know you're here.

409
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,958
No, let him play.

410
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,833
The nymphs will hide him
safely in the forest,

411
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,958
one piece here,
one piece there.

actually as terrible
as you've been taught.

447
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:03,125
We have a lot of nice things.

448
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:06,291
Like music. It's so lovely.

449
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,541
You must be the guardian
of music in your world.

450
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,416
Not yet.

451
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:14,833
But my dream is to fill
my whole life with music.

452
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:17,083
As soon as my uncle gets better,

453
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:20,250
my musician friends and I are
leaving for the big city.

454
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,583
"The big city".

455
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,416
What is the big city?

456
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:29,708
It's a place where everything
is made of bricks and stone

457
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,416
and there are as many buildings

458
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,875
as there are trees
in the forest...

459
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:34,708
Hurry up, hurry up. Move!

460
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,708
What are you doing?
Back off, shrubby.

461
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,000
Hush! Mavka!

462
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:43,500
Are you the ones
making all this noise?

463
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:45,416
Too late.

464
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,791
Nice knowing you, Mavka.

465
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:49,708
Up until today, anyway.

466
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,916
Lesh, how's it going?

467
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:54,250
Busier than I'd like.

468
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:57,166
Who is your guest?

469
00:33:57,208 --> 00:34:01,083
Uh, I'm...Hush's...cousin.

470
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:03,875
Yes, dropped by
for a visit from overseas.

471
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,083
Right, Hush?

472
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,875
Uh-huh.

473
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:13,666
A very, very
many-times-removed cousin.

474
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:17,041
Shmucas is his name.

475
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:20,500
Ah! Welcome, friend Shmucas.

476
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:24,791
Come quickly.
The ceremony is about to begin.

477
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:30,125
Oh, great. What do we do now?

478
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:33,041
Do you realise how illegal
this is?

479
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:36,458
We just need to keep our
distance from the new guardian.

480
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,250
As soon as the ceremony is over,
I'll come up with something.

481
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,583
You look just like
your parents, madam.

482
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:54,708
Hm, much better now.

483
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,041
Yeah. Lovely portrait.

484
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,958
Totally...horridness.

485
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,041
Hmm?

486
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,166
Hmm. Did you find the tree?

487
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:14,583
So what stopped you?

488
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:17,791
Bunnies? Squirrels?
The forest demons?

489
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,583
Knuckleheads.

490
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:25,833
Totally useless. Oh!

491
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,041
Stop being such fools.

492
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,958
You are stupid idiots.

493
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,791
What am I paying you for?

494
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:34,833
And where is the boy?

495
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,416
Oh!

496
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:41,458
-Out of my way.

497
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,500
Oh!

498
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,916
Oh, damn!

499
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,833
I'm running out of time.

500
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,791
And where is this peasant loser?

501
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,750
Ohhh! Oh!

502
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:07,166
-Hey.

503
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,541
Shhh!

504
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,708
It is time.

505
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:18,000
Hmm!

506
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:26,250
Oh! That's the...

507
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:29,583
The Supreme Spirits of Nature,

508
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,833
I summon you.

509
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:36,250
The One Who Dwells in the Earth,

510
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:38,750
I call on you.

511
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:47,541
The One Who Moves the Waters,

512
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:50,875
I call on you.

513
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:57,958
The One Who Flies
with the Wind...

514
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,541
..the One Who Sits
on the Rock...

515
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:06,666
..I call on you.

516
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,625
Those who protect us,

517
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,916
those who help us,

518
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,291
those who dwell
at the Source of Life,

519
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:21,916
please choose the new guardian.

520
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,416
Mm.

521
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,625
Hmm?

522
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,916
The guardian is chosen.

523
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,250
Huh?

524
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:05,041
-Her?
-Me?

525
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,125
What's happening?
Is it good or bad?

526
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:13,500
Please close the knothole
on the front of your face.

527
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:15,916
Lesh, why me?

528
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:18,333
I can't possibly be
the guardian.

529
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,208
I have to tell you something.

530
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,333
The Supreme Spirits are wise,

531
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:28,375
and they know who is capable
of protecting our realm.

532
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:31,208
Now the Supreme Spirits

533
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,791
will bestow their powers
on the chosen one.

534
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,041
-Incredible.
-Perfect.

535
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:08,541
So how do we "keep our distance
from the new guardian" now?

536
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,291
Mavka, you are now granted

537
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:18,875
the powers of
the Supreme Spirits of Nature.

538
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,791
It is for you now

539
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:24,166
to always remember
that our enemy -

540
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:27,750
the humans - are out there.

541
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:31,416
Defend this fragile,
sacred place

542
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:33,583
with your very life.

543
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:38,041
Please welcome our new guardian

544
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:41,375
of the Source of Life
and the forest.

545
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,875
That was just...whoa!

546
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:57,875
Our little Mavka
is now the guardian.

547
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:01,083
I always knew this would happen.

548
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:05,000
There has got
to be some mistake.

549
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:07,708
Why did the spirits not choose
the strongest one?

550
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,541
With her as guardian,

551
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:12,250
our forest is more in danger
than ever.

552
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:14,375
Hey. Easy there, friend.

553
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:17,000
Who are you supposed to be?

554
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:19,583
Me? I am, uh, Hush's cousin.

555
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,583
You...

556
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,291
You stink like a human.

557
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:28,416
Yeah, he stepped in some human
on the way here.

558
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:30,666
Uh, Cousin Shmucas.

559
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:32,833
If he's a noise keeper,

560
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:35,208
I'm the new guardian
of the forest.

561
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,500
And we all know...

562
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:38,333
-..I'm not.

563
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:41,625
-Uh...oops.

564
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:44,041
Human?!

565
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:46,750
Run. Move your footsticks.

566
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:50,916
You treacherous human.
You have tricked me!

567
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:53,083
-Human?
-Oh, no, he's a human.

568
00:42:58,041 --> 00:42:59,791
Don't let him get away!

569
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:02,541
Am I the only one here
who's completely confused?

570
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,291
Hush!

571
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:09,333
You've got a great deal
of explaining to do.

572
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,416
Argh!

573
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:22,166
-Huh?

574
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,541
Argh!

575
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,791
Argh!

576
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:59,041
Argh!

577
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,958
Argh!

578
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:16,166
-Mavka.
-Get on, quick.

579
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:17,541
The lynx will take you home.

580
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:20,583
Whoa! Sounds safe.

581
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,416
Nice...kitty.

582
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:23,791
Take this.

583
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:26,041
It will heal your uncle.

584
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,000
Thank you.

585
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,708
-Huh?

586
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:35,666
There's no time.
Go...and never return.

587
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:38,083
Death is the only thing
for a human to seek here.

588
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:40,500
-Go!
-Wait!

589
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:42,083
I promised I'd play for you.

590
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:46,291
Where is he? Where's the human?

591
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,916
He got away.

592
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:50,833
What? How did he...

593
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,750
You helped him?

594
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:56,000
You have the powers
of the guardian

595
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:58,000
at your disposal,
you could have -

596
00:44:58,041 --> 00:45:01,375
no, you should have -
stopped him.

597
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:03,666
The guardian
doesn't need your help

598
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:06,625
deciding how and when
to use her powers, Ondina.

599
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:08,333
Mavka,

600
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:11,375
this human is no different
than all the others.

601
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:13,208
He will betray you.

602
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:17,666
And when he does,
we will all pay the price.

603
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:38,791
Hmm.

604
00:45:47,916 --> 00:45:49,250
Frol!

605
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:51,416
Yes, madam?

606
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:54,833
There's something
about this boy Lucas

607
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:57,125
I don't trust.

608
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:58,500
Watch him.

609
00:45:58,541 --> 00:46:00,125
I'm not so sure

610
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:03,125
he came back from the forest
empty-handed.

611
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:04,375
Me?!

612
00:46:04,416 --> 00:46:07,541
Madam, I am a fashion tsar
in the making,

613
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:09,458
not a spy.

614
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,875
Oh, that's too bad.

615
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:15,083
If I get what I want,
I could establish you

616
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:17,666
as the number one fashion god...

617
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,625
..in the world.

618
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:24,333
With my own Soul of Frol
Manly Lace Boutique?

619
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:26,416
With a global chain

620
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:29,708
of whatever insane thing
you just said.

621
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,708
Then, if you need a spy,

622
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,208
why, Frol is your guy.

623
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,208
Ugh. Uh!

624
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:51,750
Silks, ribbons and laces
don't have to be disgraces.

625
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:53,666
That's the Soul of Frol.

626
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:59,916
No. This really happened to me.
Last night.

627
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:04,125
The forest is full of -
not demons - but creatures.

628
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:06,666
And they are
not fond of us at all.

629
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:12,208
Except Mavka. She is very nice.

630
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:19,833
Danger or no,
I have to go back to the forest

631
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:22,250
to Mavka, to thank her.

632
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:26,416
Lucas, look, if you've been at
the village fair all night long

633
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:30,541
and plan on going back,
you can just tell me.

634
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,416
Busted. You know me.

635
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,541
Party animal.

636
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:36,708
Best carnival ever.

637
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:49,541
Mmm!

638
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,458
So how is this,

639
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,416
uh, perdi-caca-something-um

640
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:06,208
supposed to work?

641
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,416
I have less than no idea.

642
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:13,291
-Huh?

643
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,000
Uncle?

644
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,750
Whoa!

645
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:29,125
Hah! And no pain.

646
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:31,916
I haven't stood this straight
in 20 years.

647
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:34,833
It's a miracle.

648
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:39,708
It is a miracle.

649
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:44,625
It's a miracle
of perdi-caca-something-um.

650
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:47,083
I've got so much energy.

651
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,708
Now I'll be Hercu-Leo.

652
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,750
Hey, let's take up curling.

653
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:30,041
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

654
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:37,041
Yeah, it's bit more
complicated now.

655
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:40,583
But, Swampy, think for yourself.

656
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:44,083
How can he play his beautiful
music without his flute?

657
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,958
We have to return this to Lucas.

658
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:56,541
What if something happens
in the forest while I'm gone?

659
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,708
What if nothing happens
while I'm here?

660
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,583
You're absolutely right.

661
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,708
I'm the guardian now.
I can't leave the forest.

662
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,916
Humans are enemies.

663
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:10,708
I somehow managed to live
without Lucas before.

664
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,541
Or his music.

665
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:14,125
Or his eyes.

666
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:15,500
Or his smile.

667
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:17,541
Or this feeling

668
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:19,666
that now lives right here.

669
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:40,791
Hmm. Mmm.

670
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:44,166
Madam! Madam! Where's Madam?

671
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:58,750
Madam
is probably upstairs.

672
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:00,500
-Gah!

673
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:06,000
Madam! Madam!

674
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,166
Madam, you were right!

675
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:13,583
Eugh!

676
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,333
That icky boy lied to you!

677
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,541
Here.

678
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:26,083
Oh.

679
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,625
Lucas was at the Source of Life.

680
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:32,833
The heart of the forest.

681
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:36,916
And I also found this.

682
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:41,125
Finally it will be mine!

683
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:45,416
But...but there is nothing
marked here!

684
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:49,166
Now think! Did Lucas
say anything about the tree?

685
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:50,541
No!

686
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:52,333
Nothing about the tree,

687
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,750
but he just said
he will go into the forest again

688
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:57,458
to see the nice forest.

689
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,000
The magma! Boy, what a fool.

690
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:02,208
It doesn't make sense.

691
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,000
The nice forest magma?

692
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:06,625
Yeah, that's what he said.

693
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:10,291
He probably wants to keep
the source to himself.

694
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,708
-Frol.
-Yes, Madam?

695
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,208
-Keep an eye on this boy.

696
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,916
When he decides to go
to the forest,

697
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:20,916
we need to keep him company
by all means.

698
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,625
But on the other hand,
as the guardian,

699
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:36,375
shouldn't I learn as much
about our enemies as I can?

700
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:40,333
If Lucas isn't evil, maybe other
humans aren't evil either.

701
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:45,083
Oh, stop croaking about
the law of the forest!

702
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:47,291
Maybe it's time
for things to change

703
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:51,208
so that the forest-dwellers
and humans could live in peace.

704
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,333
Oh!

705
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,750
Uhh, no! I can't show up
looking like this.

706
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:13,875
-Hm!

707
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:17,166
Huh?

708
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:20,208
Gotta find something
a human would wear.

709
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:01,791
Hey, boy. I'm making a gift.

710
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:07,500
Yes, Dot,
Mavka is going to love me.

711
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:09,875
Uh, it! It.

712
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:18,083
And...done.

713
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:27,375
-Hey, where are the pies?!

714
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,875
Pie-demolisher!

715
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:32,791
-It's fine.

716
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:34,708
I'm not perfect either.

717
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,291
For instance, I'm about to
break my promise to Hush

718
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:38,916
and the forest law

719
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:41,250
in order to keep
my promise to Mavka.

720
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:49,583
Mavka, are you here?

721
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:52,791
Your hair! How are you here?

722
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:54,833
Aren't you happy to see me?

723
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,000
No. I mean, yes!

724
00:54:57,041 --> 00:54:59,458
Heart-burstingly happy,

725
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,416
which is a thing I probably
shouldn't say out loud.

726
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:06,541
Oh, is this your nest?

727
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:10,875
I prefer
to think of it as a cave.

728
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:14,791
Is this for making music too?

729
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:18,500
-Uh, no.

730
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:23,000
Those are regular instruments,
not musical instruments.

731
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:24,708
I've come to return your flute.

732
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:27,000
It was broken, but I...

733
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:29,000
Here.

734
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:33,958
Thank you.

735
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:46,458
Now you can go to the stone
forest and follow your dream.

736
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,750
Just play for me one last time
and then I'll leave.

737
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:52,250
No. No, don't leave!

738
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:54,083
Uh, I have an idea.

739
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:56,333
I'll play even better music
for you.

740
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:59,166
There's a festival in town and
my band is playing. Let's go!

741
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,166
-Uh...
- Don't be afraid.

742
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,000
It'll be good
for guardian of the forest

743
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:08,708
to know more about us humans,
right?

744
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,583
Uh...

745
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:14,583
-You're gonna love it.

746
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,708
Huh?

747
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:44,500
Mavka, let's find you
an outfit that says,

748
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:47,041
"I am a non-alarming
local human."

749
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:48,750
What's wrong with this one?

750
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:51,125
Well, it kind of screams,

751
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:53,833
"Howdy, I'm a barely disguised
forest demon

752
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:55,416
"from behind the Dark Mountain."

753
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:58,500
Oh!

754
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:28,541
Oh.

755
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,083
-Oh!

756
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:36,916
-Hm?

757
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:49,916
-And this is my uncle Leo.
-Oh!

758
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:52,125
He's the one you saved
with your gift.

759
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:06,333
Hm?

760
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:09,750
What have you done?

761
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:14,333
Oh! Those are
my friends playing.

762
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:05,208
This music, the dancing -
how delightful!

763
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,000
But you still play better
than anybody else.

764
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:10,083
He was born that way!

765
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:13,041
So, Lucas,
Uncle Leo is recovered.

766
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,833
He looks better than you now.

767
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:17,833
Isn't it time to show
your talent to the big city?

768
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:20,541
Um, well...

769
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:24,333
Or has the music shown you
a different way?

770
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:27,333
A very beautiful way.

771
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:30,208
Well, your call, Romeo.

772
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,416
We're always happy
to have you with us.

773
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:34,541
Pack up. We gotta go.

774
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:37,875
Oh, that's right, it's late.
I must go too.

775
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:41,666
Thank you for the wonderful time
and for the gift.

776
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:45,500
Wait! I haven't fulfilled
my promise yet.

777
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:10,208
-Look! A demon from the forest!

778
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:15,375
-She's glowing!
-Green hair!

779
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:18,666
An evil spirit from behind
the Dark Mountain!

780
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:20,166
What shall we do?

781
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:22,833
She's come to kill
our lovey ones

782
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:25,625
and destroy our food crops!

783
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:28,250
No! It's not true!

784
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,708
This lad is trying
to protect the demon.

785
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:32,291
She has bewitched him.

786
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:34,500
-She'll put a curse on us.

787
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:36,000
Get her!

788
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:38,750
No! She won't hurt anyone.

789
01:00:47,666 --> 01:00:49,166
-Lucas!

790
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:50,625
No!

791
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:52,333
- Hm...
-Argh!

792
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,583
Let me go! Lucas!

793
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:10,833
What do we do?

794
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,458
-Burn her, right?
-No, they drown witches!

795
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,083
Let's do both!

796
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:18,541
My fellow villagers,
I was wrong.

797
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:22,750
The evil spirits of the forest
are very real.

798
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:27,583
And now I see that it was her
kind that burned up my father,

799
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:30,666
the goodly sawmill owner.

800
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:32,541
How dare she!

801
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:33,875
But fear not!

802
01:01:33,916 --> 01:01:36,208
My eyes are open now

803
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,791
and I will find out what
the demons have in store for us,

804
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,333
be it plague...

805
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:42,791
-..drought...

806
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:47,208
-..famine, fire or flood!

807
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:50,208
And where the Source of Life is.

808
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:55,458
-Oh!

809
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,458
-What is this?!

810
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,291
-What's happening?
-Black magic!

811
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:10,000
-Argh!

812
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:18,750
Don't let her get away!

813
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,625
-Lesh!

814
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:47,958
Where'd he go?
Is he gone?

815
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:51,375
All is lost!

816
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:56,166
My strong silks, my robust
ribbons, my manly laces,

817
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:59,583
the Soul of Frol - gone!

818
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,625
Oh!

819
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:11,833
It isn't over yet,
my whiny little pet.

820
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:18,458
My poor, dear,
terrified fellow villagers,

821
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,333
we underestimated
the demon's power

822
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:24,041
and the results were tragic.

823
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:28,541
But this is not the end.

824
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:30,166
They'll soon be back!

825
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:33,333
-Oh, no! What do we do?
-Oh, this is terrible!

826
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:37,083
There's only one way
to stop this evil.

827
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:38,833
Strike first!

828
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,791
Lesh,
how did you find me?

829
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:52,416
Hush told me everything.

830
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:55,416
I don't understand what's
happening. Those humans...

831
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,291
Calm down now.

832
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,708
Those humans obviously conspired

833
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,458
to lure you into a trap.

834
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:08,708
I love how no matter where you
look, you see goodness, Mavka,

835
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:13,625
but you have made
the same mistake I made once

836
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:16,500
in trusting a human.

837
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:18,375
Lucas would never do that.

838
01:04:18,416 --> 01:04:20,791
I'm sure
he can explain everything.

839
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:30,333
-Mavka!?

840
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:45,041
Now, Lucas,

841
01:04:45,083 --> 01:04:47,708
be a good boy of limited
intellect and integrity

842
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,458
and mark the Source of Life
on this crudely drawn map.

843
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:58,875
Never gonna happen, lady.

844
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:02,125
Somebody found a backbone!

845
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:05,541
Let's see if we can't just
melt it like meringue.

846
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:07,625
Ooh, I'm peckish.

847
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,166
Oh, no!

848
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,583
Don't touch her!

849
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:24,458
The source...

850
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,541
-..or she dies.

851
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:37,750
Now let Mavka go!

852
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,958
Sure thing, ding-a-ling.

853
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:44,875
Oh, Lucas!
Smooch, smooch, swoon!

854
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:47,833
Oh, you saved me! You saved me!

855
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:51,750
You're so, so dumb.

856
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:55,583
No! Kylina, you won't
get away with this!

857
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:58,375
-Ah! Ah!

858
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:02,416
Really?
Guess I'll just stop, then.

859
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,041
Have a nice swim, sweetie!

860
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:19,125
So much water has flowed past
since that fateful day,

861
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:23,416
the time has come for me
to tell the full truth.

862
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:28,458
The battle
all those winters ago -

863
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:32,791
I've never told anyone
the reason why it happened.

864
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:39,333
The sawmill owner
came to me in tears.

865
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:43,250
He was begging me to save
his newborn daughter...

866
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:47,958
..and I believed in goodness
in him.

867
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:52,083
I gave this human

868
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:55,708
a drop from
the Source of Life itself.

869
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:59,000
Soon, he returned with...

870
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:02,166
..well, with an army of humans.

871
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:06,208
They wanted the Source of Life
for themselves.

872
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:12,416
So, I called for the Supreme
Spirit of the Underworld,

873
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:17,166
the One Who Sits in the Rock,
to give me the Spark of Rage.

874
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:23,166
And, may all those I love
forgive me,

875
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:25,708
he did.

876
01:07:27,208 --> 01:07:32,291
Everything good in me
was replaced by sheer rage.

877
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:36,958
I burned and the world burned.

878
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:46,791
Humans and the forest alike.

879
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:52,666
Fire and hatred without end.

880
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:06,625
Have you seen Lucas?

881
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:09,208
Have you seen my boy, Lucas?

882
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,541
Oh!

883
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:14,041
Your boy's been taken by
the evil forest demons.

884
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:17,458
-Huh?
-Stings, right?

885
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:22,083
But you can still save him
if you join us.

886
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:25,333
Take the weapon, old man.
I'm on a schedule here!

887
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:29,291
You stay here and make sure
nobody finds the boy...

888
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:32,833
..unless you were just dying
to be in the battle?

889
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:38,875
This is for our home!

890
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:40,833
And my youthful skin.

891
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:44,208
Now let's go
eradicate those demons

892
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:47,000
for the good of
all we hold dear!

893
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:51,083
-Yes!
-Yes! Death to the demons!

894
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:53,916
Start the forest killer!

895
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:28,208
Humans are preparing
to attack the forest.

896
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,708
Uh!

897
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:37,333
Hey! Somebody! Anybody! Hey!

898
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,208
Dot? Dot, is that you?

899
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,541
Good boy!

900
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:02,250
Run! Find someone to help me!
Hurry!

901
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:15,833
So, that's it. War is here.

902
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:19,916
The sawmill owner's daughter...

903
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:21,916
I know what to do!

904
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:25,166
What? Decorate their axes
with flowers?

905
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:28,333
I know what we all need to do -
fight!

906
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:30,625
No! There's another way!

907
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:35,083
I am the guardian
and this is my call. Wait here.

908
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:39,666
-Don't look at me.

909
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:42,583
She is the guardian.

910
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:17,500
What's going on?

911
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,666
Whoa!

912
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:36,041
Please stop!

913
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,333
Hm.

914
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:43,041
I might've frightened
the people at the fair,

915
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:45,958
but the forest means no harm
to humans.

916
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,708
We can live in peace
and even help each other.

917
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:52,041
"Help each other"?

918
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:55,250
A long time ago,
the forest gave a drop

919
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,750
from the Source of Life
to the owner of the sawmill

920
01:11:57,791 --> 01:12:00,583
so he could heal
his sick newborn daughter.

921
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:03,125
The forest saved you!

922
01:12:03,166 --> 01:12:06,416
What? Nobody ever told me!

923
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:09,208
It is the truth.

924
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:12,083
The truth?

925
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:18,250
The truth is the sawmill owner
never had a daughter,

926
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:22,291
but he had a beautiful wife that
came up with a tragic story

927
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:25,125
about a little sick daughter.

928
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:27,916
My husband was obedient
but weak.

929
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:30,458
He only got me
the one lousy drop

930
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,958
that kept me young and fit
for all these years.

931
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,125
But how does this
make us enemies?

932
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:39,333
Oh, you'll never
understand this. Look at you!

933
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:43,958
You're Nature's queen,
glowing and gorgeous forever!

934
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,041
You don't know nothing about
crow's-feet, turkey neck,

935
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:48,875
back fat.

936
01:12:48,916 --> 01:12:52,583
You'll never get old
and saggy and shrivelled.

937
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:54,666
But I can give you
one more drop.

938
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:57,708
That is so nice of you,

939
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:03,333
but, see, if I get hold of
the entire Source of Life,

940
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:07,250
I will not only be young
and beautiful forever,

941
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:09,083
but it'll also make me

942
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:13,208
the richest,
most powerful woman ever.

943
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:16,166
But without the Source of Life,
the forest will die.

944
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:18,375
It's gonna die
one way or the other, honey,

945
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:20,666
so why not just
get out of my way?

946
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:22,541
Hm.

947
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:29,833
Not all humans are
as cruel and selfish as you are!

948
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:35,458
Oh, you're thinking about
that lad of yours? Lucas?

949
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,500
Huh?

950
01:13:42,666 --> 01:13:44,583
Do you have any idea
where he is?

951
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:49,083
I...

952
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:51,875
I'll tell you another truth,
sister.

953
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:55,666
I paid Lucas very well
so he would find the source

954
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:57,833
and lure you into the village.

955
01:13:57,875 --> 01:14:02,333
-Huh?
-He took his money and left.

956
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:10,708
To the city?

957
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,208
Exactly.

958
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,625
Oh.

959
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:19,833
And one more thing.

960
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:23,625
Lucas told me it was
almost too easy to fool you

961
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:27,041
because you're just so nice.

962
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:28,833
Oh.

963
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:33,291
Now get out of my way

964
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:36,291
and take your
freaky woodland zoo with you!

965
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:49,375
Mavka! I knew we couldn't
trust that Shmucas!

966
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:52,333
I got it so wrong, Hush.

967
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:55,750
Humans really are all evil.
Lucas is...

968
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:58,041
Huh! Huh!

969
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,375
Who are you, friend?

970
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:08,958
You're saying
Shmucas didn't betray us?!

971
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:11,625
-Do you believe him?

972
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,416
Then I have an idea.

973
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:22,166
Mm! Frol Style!
Madam is going to love it!

974
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:27,250
Huh?

975
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,208
Well? Where's our hero?

976
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,666
Hm! Hm!

977
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:43,041
Go get Shmucas
and I'll deal with this one.

978
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:45,083
-Huh?

979
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:46,375
Hm!

980
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:50,208
Argh!

981
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,375
I will slice you into
robust little ribbons!

982
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:03,666
Dot?

983
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:20,833
Get back here,
you rotten cabbage!

984
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:27,875
Oh-ho-ho! You have
awakened the beast now!

985
01:17:27,916 --> 01:17:30,416
Knock, knock! Anybody home?

986
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:37,791
Ooh!

987
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:14,416
-Hm.

988
01:18:56,833 --> 01:19:00,500
Am I glad to see you!

989
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:04,666
Ooh!

990
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:13,666
Oh-oh-oh!

991
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:16,000
Huh? Oh!

992
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:35,125
Hm.

993
01:20:02,541 --> 01:20:07,083
So, that's where you're hiding,
you rotten old stump!

994
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:15,958
This is all my fault.

995
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:19,750
I have to stop this.

996
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:27,166
Supreme Spirit,

997
01:20:27,208 --> 01:20:29,458
the One Who Sits in the Rock,

998
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,375
I call on you!

999
01:20:31,416 --> 01:20:36,083
No! Mavka, don't!

1000
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:48,375
You have called me, Guardian.

1001
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:56,166
I beg you, give me the strength
to answer my calling.

1002
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:59,416
I need the Spark of Rage
to protect the forest.

1003
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:03,166
The Spark of Rage has its price.

1004
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:06,041
The price paid
by the previous guardian

1005
01:21:06,083 --> 01:21:09,333
was his enormous strength.

1006
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:13,333
The rage burned him out
from the inside.

1007
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:15,625
And you,

1008
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:19,333
the Spark will cost you
your life.

1009
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:24,250
You shall enter the Nothingness
for eternity.

1010
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:28,750
I agree, for this
treacherous feeling here,

1011
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:31,833
now it brings only pain.

1012
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:35,166
As you wish, Guardian.

1013
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:42,333
Ondina was right.

1014
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:45,000
I was too nice.

1015
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:07,333
Whoa!

1016
01:22:14,958 --> 01:22:16,750
I forgot to mention...

1017
01:22:16,791 --> 01:22:19,791
I've got you now, weed-face!

1018
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:22,333
..I'm allergic to chainsaws!

1019
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:31,500
Hush, you alright?

1020
01:22:31,541 --> 01:22:33,416
Oh, Shmucas!

1021
01:22:33,458 --> 01:22:37,375
I'm fine. Got some yellow spots,
but, overall, fine.

1022
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:39,333
-Huh?

1023
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:49,041
This village has the worst aura!

1024
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:56,000
Hush, please,
I need to find Mavka!

1025
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:58,875
What the hometown hurricane
is that?!

1026
01:22:58,916 --> 01:23:02,375
It seems that IS Mavka.

1027
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:18,416
Oh!

1028
01:23:32,791 --> 01:23:34,541
-Whoa!

1029
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:43,791
Mavka!

1030
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:47,791
It's me, Lucas! I'm here!

1031
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:52,000
Argh, I've got to get closer!

1032
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:55,125
I might be able to help
with that.

1033
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:01,875
Thank you, dear cousin.

1034
01:24:01,916 --> 01:24:06,458
Ha! They'll call me Hush,
who first befriended humans.

1035
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,958
Uh...uh... Whoa!

1036
01:24:12,708 --> 01:24:15,166
-Whoa!

1037
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:17,791
Mavka! It's me!

1038
01:24:17,833 --> 01:24:20,291
Please! You have to stop!

1039
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:23,500
Aah!

1040
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:27,916
Whoa! Aah! Oh!

1041
01:24:30,625 --> 01:24:32,791
-Oh!

1042
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:37,250
Where are you going?
You're gonna die!

1043
01:24:37,291 --> 01:24:41,000
I don't care.
I have to save her.

1044
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:43,291
There's nothing you can do.

1045
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:46,791
She can no longer understand
your words. Do you copy?

1046
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:48,208
What did you say?

1047
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:52,500
I said she can't hear
your words! Run!

1048
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:55,416
Hush, you are a genius!

1049
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:59,958
Finally I can scratch
hearing that off my bucket list!

1050
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,791
She can't hear my words,
but what if...

1051
01:25:34,333 --> 01:25:38,916
I got it! I got it!
They need our help.

1052
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:56,541
We should all do this together!

1053
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Mavka, it's me.

1054
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:55,250
Hear me, please!

1055
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:09,625
Come back to me. Please!

1056
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:37,666
Is this what Nothingness
feels like?

1057
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:41,541
This is
the place of no phantom dreams,

1058
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:45,416
where no songs are carried
by the wind.

1059
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:49,458
The fire of hate and rage
does not burn here.

1060
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,541
Rage doesn't burn
in my heart anymore.

1061
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:58,666
I heard his voice and now
I know he never betrayed me.

1062
01:27:58,708 --> 01:28:02,333
You have chosen
to spare the lives of the humans

1063
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:04,875
who have caused you
so much pain.

1064
01:28:06,416 --> 01:28:08,583
But they also
gave me something

1065
01:28:08,625 --> 01:28:11,000
I've never felt before.

1066
01:28:14,166 --> 01:28:16,500
We have made the right choice

1067
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:19,625
making you the new guardian.

1068
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:22,916
You have bridged the gap
between the humans

1069
01:28:22,958 --> 01:28:25,583
and the forest-dwellers,

1070
01:28:25,625 --> 01:28:29,500
but now you have to pay
the promised price

1071
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:34,083
and remain in
the Nothingness forever.

1072
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:36,125
For eternity.

1073
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:45,666
No.

1074
01:28:45,708 --> 01:28:49,083
I'm alive
and I will live on forever

1075
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:53,375
because now my heart is full of
something that will never die.

1076
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:16,625
Through the darkness,
I heard your music.

1077
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:20,583
It filled me here.

1078
01:29:20,625 --> 01:29:24,375
Your music is the real magic.

1079
01:29:24,416 --> 01:29:26,541
No.

1080
01:29:26,583 --> 01:29:30,708
The only magic humans have
is love.

1081
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:01,791
