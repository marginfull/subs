00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:43,626
[mechanism whirs]

165
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:56,334
[footsteps thud]

166
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,001
Hello. I am Sindri,
father of this village.

167
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:21,084
Welcome.

168
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,459
I'm Admiral Atticus Noble.

169
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:25,834
Loyal representative of the slain King.

170
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,626
I welcome you to his warm embrace.

171
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:49,376
Please, father,
tell me about this beautiful village.

172
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,334
Walk with me up to our Longhouse.

173
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:55,626
We can have a cup of ale
and I will tell you about life here.

174
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,209
Oh. Sounds perfect. Lead the way.

175
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,168
[Sindri] We've carved out
a simple life here.

176
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,709
And we take pride
in the love of our community,

177
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,918
and the hard work
it takes to survive here.

178
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:26,001
[Noble] Your people
seem healthy and well-fed.

179
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:29,001
As their leader, much of that prosperity
must be credited to you.

180
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:32,001
No, we are a community.
The credit is no one person's.

181
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:34,418
Oh, I know that in the best of times,
the credit's shared,

182
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:38,043
but when the stores are empty,
you know where the responsibility falls.

183
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:41,126
The weight of the leader, I suppose.

184
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:47,626
So you… you understand
the feeling of, like, a father,

185
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,084
the need to feed your children, yes?

186
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:54,626
I was hoping that your land
and the people of Veldt might help

187
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:58,376
as we search for a small band
of revolutionaries hiding in this system.

188
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,209
Who my commander, the Regent Balisarius,
bid me find and bring to justice.

189
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:05,793
We are humble farmers,

190
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:08,334
far removed from the politics
of the Motherworld.

191
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:12,001
- [ax clatters]
- And still you can serve. Hmm.

192
00:15:12,084 --> 00:15:15,501
The rebels we seek
have been attacking our supply ports.

193
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:19,293
Led by a woman named Devra Bloodaxe,
and her brother Darrian.

194
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:22,001
Their capture's inevitable.

195
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:25,126
However,
it's taken longer than anticipated,

196
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,001
and we found ourselves
admittedly low on stores.

197
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:32,668
And as you know or may have heard,
an army runs on its stomach.

198
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:37,543
I was thinking of a partnership,
where you supply us with food.

199
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:40,126
Whatever you have to spare, of course.

200
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,584
In exchange, you're compensated at…

201
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,626
Let's call it triple
the market value, shall we?

202
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:50,459
With that windfall, you'll be able
to buy plenty of harvesters, robots,

203
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:52,751
and won't have to do
this difficult work by hand.

204
00:15:55,418 --> 00:15:59,459
We believe that doing the work by hand
connects us to the land

205
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,376
and honors these sacred fields
that give us life.

206
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:05,459
[Noble] There's peace of mind knowing
that you're invaluable

207
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:08,959
in the important mission of
rooting out enemies of the Motherworld.

208
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,084
- [Sindri] It's quite a proposal.
- [Noble] Yes.

209
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:26,084
[Sindri] If only we had
some surplus to offer.

210
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,043
You see, the land is rocky

211
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:31,959
and yields barely enough
to feed ourselves.

212
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:34,918
So, it is with sincere apologies
that we must decline the offer.

213
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:36,834
However, we are grateful

214
00:16:36,918 --> 00:16:40,584
for the presence of such
a benevolent and powerful protector.

215
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:44,959
Huh.

216
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:46,043
No surplus?

217
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:49,626
- None at all?
- [chuckles]

218
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:51,834
[Noble] Huh.

219
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:53,459
But your land looks so fertile.

220
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:56,834
Your fields seem larger
than what your population might need.

221
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:58,918
Of course, I understand how it might seem.

222
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:03,293
Yet the scale of the planting
is evidence of the poor soil.

223
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:06,334
And our harsh winters
only add to the short season.

224
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:08,876
Now, what do you say
we share that cup of ale, eh?

225
00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:13,084
[Noble scoffs]

226
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:22,334
Sorry.

227
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,543
It's just…

228
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:27,834
I mean, look at these beautiful people.

229
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:32,126
I can't imagine these glowing complexions
are nourished by a barren field.

230
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:34,793
[Noble chuckles]

231
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:40,876
Now… who's the man or woman among you
who oversees the harvest?

232
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,459
There must be one
whose thumb is greener than the rest.

233
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:49,376
[Noble chuckles]

234
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:50,459
Someone?

235
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:52,709
Hmm?

236
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:54,501
[Gunnar] Yes, sir.

237
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:56,001
- [Noble] Ah.
- That is me.

238
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:57,709
[Noble] Good.

239
00:17:57,793 --> 00:17:59,751
Yes, I oversee the harvest.

240
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:03,501
Well, if these people trust you,
then so do I.

241
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:08,043
Trying to understand how I could be
so wrong about what this land could yield.

242
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:09,334
That's all.

243
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:13,584
Well, sir.

244
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:22,043
Sindri, our beloved father, is always
looking out for the welfare of our village

245
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:26,168
and so insists on keeping reserves
in case of famine or drought,

246
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:28,959
which, as you know,
is the responsibility of a leader.

247
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:35,168
[splutters] But we have been lucky
these last few seasons.

248
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:38,293
Our surplus has been
more than we can store.

249
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:40,834
So, there might be

250
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:44,459
a chance that we can spare a small amount.

251
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:47,126
Depending, of course,
on the scale of your needs.

252
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,668
Mmm. Good. Good.

253
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:53,043
Yeah, I mean, it's always wise
to hold some in reserve, isn't it, father?

254
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:56,418
Yep. Yep.

255
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:02,751
I am confused though.

256
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,251
Curious why you should have me believe

257
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:07,626
this land could barely yield enough
to feed your people.

258
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:10,251
- Seems that wasn't entirely true.
- [Gunnar] No, wait, wait.

259
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:13,751
Admiral, no one is trying to mislead you.

260
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:18,834
Sindri simply has a slightly more
conservative view on reserves than I do.

261
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:22,501
But we're both excited
about a possible partnership.

262
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,876
Just bear in mind
the reality of what we can supply.

263
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:34,709
Father, who is this exactly?

264
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,959
- Uh… My…
- [Sindri] He's of no consequence.

265
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:41,251
I have been empowered
by my people to speak for them.

266
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:44,251
This man has no authority here.

267
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:47,709
You would be wise to ignore him.

268
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:50,418
[Noble] Well… a rift.

269
00:19:51,168 --> 00:19:53,959
It's not quite
the idyllic community I'd first seen.

270
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,668
Father, if I may

271
00:19:58,084 --> 00:20:02,793
offer you some advice when dealing with
subordinates who need to be kept in place.

272
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:07,668
I find people can lose sight of the stakes
and sometimes need a gentle reminder

273
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:11,126
of just how those with power
deal with those without.

274
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:41,501
[Sindri] Admiral.

275
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:43,418
Sindri…

276
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:45,001
Please.

277
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,084
- No, I… I would never…
- It's fine.

278
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:51,876
[Noble sighs]

279
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,293
- [nervously] I…
- Let me show you what I mean.

280
00:20:56,043 --> 00:20:57,043
Uh…

281
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:58,959
[Sindri] Please.

282
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:02,251
Admiral.

283
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:05,418
[villagers gasp]

284
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:11,168
[Noble yells]

285
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:12,668
[Gunnar] No, stop!

286
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,376
[villagers scream]

287
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:15,459
[villager] No!

288
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:17,668
[Krypteian blade buzzes]

289

[she sobs]

291
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,043
[Gunnar] What did you do?

292
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:30,834
When can I expect my harvest?

293
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:33,334
[shuddering] Oh…

294
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:34,418
I don't…

295
00:21:36,043 --> 00:21:39,168
I said, tell me, partner,
when I can expect my harvest.

296
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:41,876
Uh… Um… [splutters]

297
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,251
- Nine… nine weeks.
- Very well.

298
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:47,751
In ten weeks, I shall return.

299
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,376
You shall have
my 10,000 bushels prepared for my ship.

300
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:55,418
Twelve… We barely produce 12,000 bushels.

301
00:21:55,501 --> 00:21:56,793
We'll starve to death.

302
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,418
I don't understand what you want.

303
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:01,168
Well, it's simple.

304
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:04,668
I want everything.

305
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,459
[drops hip engines blast]

306
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:23,709
All right, listen up.

307
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:26,626
I need all of this gear moved
to this big stone building.

308
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:28,251
That should suit us for now.

309
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:32,043
Marcus, you're gonna help me evict
the current residents from our new home.

310
00:22:32,126 --> 00:22:33,126
Copy?

311
00:22:33,543 --> 00:22:34,668
Copy you, boss.

312
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:37,168
Copy you.

313
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:40,168
Hello, everyone.

314
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,293
- [lever clanks]
- [air hissing]

315
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:59,293
I am JC-1435
of the Mechanicas Militarium,

316
00:22:59,376 --> 00:23:00,626
defender of the King.

317
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:03,834
Correction, of the slain King.

318
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:05,751
It is my honor to serve.

319
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:07,876
I'm Private Aris.

320
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:12,418
We're moving supplies to that building,
if you wouldn't mind lending a hand.

321
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:14,418
Thank you, Private Aris.

322
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:17,376
That falls perfectly into my protocols.

323
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:21,001
[Marcus] I'm talking to you,
you dirty drain turtle. Come here.

324
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:23,043
[shouts] The hell you waiting for?
Get out, man!

325

00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,751
[Marcus] Mmm.

328
00:23:47,918 --> 00:23:49,168
Thank you.

329
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,418
[ladle clatters]

330
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:04,334
Now, what in the name of the old gods
are you looking at?

331
00:24:04,418 --> 00:24:08,209
I'm sorry, I was just waiting to see
if you needed some more water.

332
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:09,376
Some more water?

333
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:11,251
[shouts aggressively]

[makes kissing sound]

335
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:17,751
That's how I like 'em.
Young, strong enough to put up a fight.

336
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:20,668
[commander chuckles]

337
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,918
- Boss.
- [commander] Hmm?

338
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:24,418
Look, they left us a Jimmy.

339
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:27,668
It's a Jimmy, man.

340
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:29,459
[howling]

341
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:32,584
I didn't know we had any of those left.

342
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:42,001
All right, careful. The ground's uneven
till you get to the bridge.

343
00:24:42,084 --> 00:24:45,876
Thank you, Private Aris,
but I believe I can manage.

344
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:47,584
[Marcus] They won't fight anymore.

345
00:24:47,668 --> 00:24:49,793
What do you mean they won't fight anymore?

346
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:51,709
It's something in their programming.

347
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:53,376
Once the King was killed,

348
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:57,001
they just laid down their weapons
and refused to fight.

349
00:24:57,084 --> 00:25:00,918
Just watch, no matter what I do,
he doesn't fight back.

350

- [plasma ricochets]
- [uraki whinnying]

351
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,043
[Marcus] Hey!

352
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:09,251
Careful with that stuff,
you stupid machine.

353
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:11,834
I'll turn you into scrap, you dumb shit.
You hear me?

354
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:14,251
You're not hearing me.

355

[gun fires]

356
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:20,501
[Aris] Hey! Stop.

357
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,584
What if I shoot you instead, huh?

358
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:28,459
I could kill you right now
and no one would care.

359
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:30,918
- Would they?
- [commander] That's enough.

360
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:33,376
What do you say? Wanna die?

361
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:34,543
What's it, huh?

362
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:35,626
Come on, boy.

363
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:38,376
[gun powers down]

364
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:39,501
I said, enough.

365
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:49,876
Get these crates
into that house now, Private.

366
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:51,459
Yes, boss.

367
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:01,043
Are you malfunctioning?

368
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:03,293
No, sir.

369
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:08,293
Get up. Go to the river. Clean yourself.

370
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:13,084
The rest of you, stop staring.

371
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:14,334
Get back to work.

372
00:26:14,418 --> 00:26:16,001
[Marcus] Get back to work, assholes.

373
00:26:16,084 --> 00:26:18,084
[commander] That includes you, Marcus.

374
00:26:18,168 --> 00:26:19,543
[soldier 1] You got it?

375
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:21,751
[crate clangs]

376
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,209
[Marcus grunts]

377
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:45,543
[Sam] Excuse me.

378
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:52,334
[JC-1435] Thank you. That is kind.

379
00:26:53,043 --> 00:26:55,751
- You're a soldier?
- Long ago.

380
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:00,834
Do you mind? I'm Sam.

381
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:01,918
[JC-1435] Please.

382
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:13,751
Tell me, Sam.
Do you know the story of our slain King

383
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:17,709
and his beautiful daughter,
the Princess Issa?

384
00:27:17,793 --> 00:27:18,834
I don't.

385
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:22,251
Well, you remind me of her.

386
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:27,168
In myth, she was called
the Chalice or the Redeemer.

387
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:30,084
She was <i>pueri salvatoris.</i>

388
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:32,334
And even before she was born,

389
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:35,376
I and my brothers
pledged everything we were,

390
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:38,543
everything that dwells
inside this metal skin,

391
00:27:38,626 --> 00:27:40,209
to fight in her name.

392
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:45,709
So when word reached us
on some distant battlefield

393
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:50,334
that she, as prophesied, had been born
of flesh and blood into our world,

394
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:54,209
I felt a great warmth for the universe

395
00:27:55,001 --> 00:28:00,084
and trusted that she was to usher in
a new age of peace and compassion.

396
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:03,418
And bring us home.

397
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:07,251
She was magic.

398
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:10,834
[JC-1435] Ah, yes.
She was more than magic.

399
00:28:13,293 --> 00:28:15,251
On the day of her coronation,

400
00:28:15,334 --> 00:28:18,668
she, along with
our honored King and Queen,

401
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:23,834
were assassinated in cold blood
by those they trusted most.

402
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:29,459
I fear we lost some measure
of our honor since that betrayal.

403
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,626
I'm afraid our compassion, our kindness,

404
00:28:35,418 --> 00:28:36,501
our very joy,

405
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:40,959
died with that young girl.

406
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:51,834
I think it lives in you.

407
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:35,001
This is your fault, Gunnar!

408
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:37,084
I didn't know that he would kill them.

409
00:29:37,168 --> 00:29:38,793
Doesn't matter. He's dead now.

410
00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:42,168
[villager 1] What about the soldiers?
Next, it's gonna be the other house.

411
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:44,459
- [villager 2] I don't know.
- Stop, please.

412
00:29:44,543 --> 00:29:47,834
How about we bring in the crop
and we fall on their mercy?

413
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:48,834
[villager 3] Yeah.

414
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:51,501
We make ourselves invaluable.
They wouldn't be able to kill us.

415
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:53,876
- They would need us.
- He's right.

416
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:58,834
Farming, that is our skill
that we can do, that they cannot.

417
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:02,168
If we show them how good we are,
they will be forced to spare us.

418
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:03,584
- Yes.
- Yes. Yeah.

419
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:06,959
- Do we agree? Our work fights for us.
- [all] Yes!

420
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:08,963
- Our work fights for us. Yes?
- [villagers] Yes!

421
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:11,876
[Den] It's settled then.

422
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:14,168
- We show them how valuable we are.
- [villager 3] Okay.

423
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:16,376
[Den] And when we have fulfilled
our side of the deal,

424
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:19,376
they will be forced to rethink
how much food they leave us.

425
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:20,459
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

426
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:24,376
We can appeal to those gentlemen
in the granary, appeal to their humanity.

427
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:25,793
- [villager 3] Yeah.
- Good.

428
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,876
So… it's running.

429
00:30:39,543 --> 00:30:41,876
Would've thought
you'd have had enough of that.

430
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,751
You heard them. They're delusional.

431
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:49,459
They think those soldiers will show mercy
even after what they did to Sindri,

432
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:51,334
right in front of them.

433
00:30:56,793 --> 00:30:59,209
When I found you
in the wreckage of that ship,

434
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:01,709
I considered leaving you.

435
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:04,793
I was afraid
you could bring trouble to us.

436
00:31:06,876 --> 00:31:10,376
But do I for a moment
regret bringing you into our lives?

437
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:11,876
I do not.

438
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,334
You've become a part of us.

439
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:18,668
And yet, now you leave
when we need you most.

440
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:21,459
When your people need you.

441
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:27,418
I can't.

442
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:29,501
You mean, you won't?

443
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:32,418
This place is already lost.

444
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:34,251
But what if that could change?

445
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:37,418
What if we <i>did </i>fight,
not only us, but others?

446
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:39,668
- Who else would come here and fight?
- Others! Others!

447
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:43,751
Others that have reason to hate
all that the Motherworld represents.

448
00:31:46,376 --> 00:31:49,126
Kora, you know this universe
better than I.

449
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:54,959
What if you could find
the warriors that Noble seeks?

450
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:58,543
The outlaws to fight alongside us?

451
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:02,418
If I find warriors to fight for Veldt,
I give the village hope.

452
00:32:03,418 --> 00:32:05,626
If I give them hope,
they fight and surely lose.

453
00:32:06,668 --> 00:32:08,709
I won't have that blood on my hands.

454
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:12,376
Nor will I throw my life away
the same as the rest of you.

455
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:15,584
[melancholy violin music plays]

- [Marcus] Come here.
- [Sam] What is it?

460
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:47,168
Did you need some more water?

461
00:32:47,251 --> 00:32:49,959
Just a… a little water.

462
00:32:50,459 --> 00:32:51,376
Stop it!

- Shut up!
- Get off me!

- Help me!

[Sam] No. Please!

- Someone help me, please! Please, help!

- Help me! Get off of me!

[Aris] Don't!

478

644

I'm only telling you this
so you know who I am.

645
00:47:22,751 --> 00:47:25,084
You asked how I know
that they'll destroy you.

646
00:47:27,168 --> 00:47:28,793
That's what I would do.

- [Hawkshaw grunts]
- [man groans]

655

They work for the Imperium.

657

- [man screams]
- [Gunnar] Oh, no.

659

That's our guy.
That's the man we came to see.

660
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,959
The one that introduced me
to the Bloodaxes.

661
00:48:27,501 --> 00:48:29,751
Did the Bloodaxes give you
any other way to contact them?

662
00:48:30,418 --> 00:48:34,043
No. They said they were
sheltered on a planet called Sharaan.

663
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:37,418
- Protected by a king named Levitica.
- Levitica.

664
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:41,293
Come.

[bartender speaks Xanadite]

673
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:41,584
Anyway, I think our best chance
to find the Bloodaxes

674
00:49:41,668 --> 00:49:43,626
is to contact the Leviticans.

675
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:45,001
[Kora] It might expose us.

676
00:49:45,084 --> 00:49:47,668
First we find General Titus,
then we'll see about your rebels.

Is this your owner?

Move on. He's not for sale.

680
00:50:00,043 --> 00:50:03,876
Everything's for sale in this place,
so… [inhales sharply] how much?

681
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,334
You know, I have a room upstairs…

682
00:50:06,418 --> 00:50:08,876
…with relatively clean sheets.

683
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:11,251
That's a very generous offer.
But I don't think so…

[Gunnar groans]

685

I guarantee you, by morning,

686
00:50:15,543 --> 00:50:17,709
you're gonna be begging me for more.

687
00:50:18,501 --> 00:50:20,418
- I said, move on.
- [scoffs]

688

- [tense music plays]

00:50:59,084 --> 00:51:00,918
I'm looking for information.

701
00:51:05,834 --> 00:51:11,126
Has anyone here heard of General Titus
or know where he might be?

Do you know of his location?

708
00:51:34,793 --> 00:51:38,418
Last I heard,
he was fighting in the coliseum at Pollux.

00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:49,293
Last hunter who went looking for him
ended up with his head on a pike

713
00:51:50,668 --> 00:51:52,626
outside the coliseum entrance

714
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,459
as a warning not to bother him.

So, he's on Pollux.

718
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:08,959
- That's your plan?
- That's my plan.

719
00:52:11,668 --> 00:52:12,501
What?

720
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:14,668
Guess we need to
find a ship to take us to Pollux.

721

You're catching on.

Oh.

You should have killed me.

726
00:52:28,084 --> 00:52:29,501
Now you're gonna die.

727
00:52:31,418 --> 00:52:36,668
I'm gonna give you one chance

[Kora] Were those Hawkshaws that paid you
working for the Motherworld?

00:54:41,876 --> 00:54:44,334
- I don't like bounty hunters.
- [man] I didn't ask.

00:54:44,418 --> 00:54:47,126
And to be clear,
I don't like bounty hunters either.

[Kora] So you're a gun for hire?

No. That's not my thing.

I'm more of an opportunist, you might say.

751

Aye, I understand.

Still, pay me what it's worth to you.

He has a man

Is he worth our time?

Because we can't afford to waste any.

They're requesting to rendezvous with us.

Well, if it isn't
the bastard from Saaldorun.

[man laughs]

806
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:30,918
- What brings you all the way out here?
- I missed your smiling face.

807
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:32,543
[man laughs]

808
00:58:32,626 --> 00:58:34,543
You still got
that man chained in the back?

809
00:58:34,626 --> 00:58:36,918
Tarak? Yeah,
he's working off his debt to me.

810
00:58:37,001 --> 00:58:40,543
Another couple dozen seasons,
we should be square.

811
00:58:40,626 --> 00:58:41,709
What's it to you?

812
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:43,584
You mind if we talk to him?

813
00:58:44,751 --> 00:58:46,543
Could be a deal in it for ya.

814
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:48,084
[bennu screeches]

815
00:58:48,168 --> 00:58:50,709
Well, if there's money to be made…

816
00:58:53,543 --> 00:58:54,751
Hey!

817
00:58:56,001 --> 00:58:57,668
Hey! Tarak!

818
00:58:59,209 --> 00:59:00,209
[metal sizzling]

819
00:59:00,251 --> 00:59:02,126
[man] These people want to talk to you.

820
00:59:03,793 --> 00:59:07,293
- What got that chain on your leg?
- [Tarak] A long road of mistakes.

821
00:59:08,293 --> 00:59:11,001
But if you're here to accuse me
of crimes against the Motherworld,

822
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:13,334
I'm guilty as charged.
Take it up with him.

823
00:59:13,418 --> 00:59:15,376
No. That's not why we're here.

824
00:59:17,709 --> 00:59:21,418
We're here from a small village,
and we're looking to hire some fighters

825
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:24,834
to train and protect us
against a force from the Motherworld.

826
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:28,084
- I'm no friend of the Realm.
- Okay.

827
00:59:28,168 --> 00:59:29,668
[Tarak] That's well-known.

828
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:31,668
And I'd gladly fight with you,

829
00:59:31,751 --> 00:59:34,418
but… I have a debt on my name,

830
00:59:34,501 --> 00:59:35,834
and I honor my debts.

831
00:59:37,168 --> 00:59:38,459
What's he owe you?

832
00:59:39,418 --> 00:59:40,709
[man] Uh…

833
00:59:40,793 --> 00:59:44,751
300,000 Darams ought to cover
any inconvenience I've suffered.

834
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:46,251
Oh, ya bollocks.

835
00:59:46,334 --> 00:59:48,001
We don't have that kind of money.

836
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,084
No money.

837
00:59:51,543 --> 00:59:54,793
Well, I do love to gamble.

838
00:59:55,376 --> 00:59:56,584
Here we go.

839
00:59:56,668 --> 00:59:57,668
What's the bet?

840
00:59:58,876 --> 01:00:02,543
If Tarak can break that creature
out there, his debts are squared with me.

841

[chain rattles]

842

[man] But if he don't ride him,

843
01:00:06,334 --> 01:00:09,251
you all get a chain and a shackle.

844
01:00:09,334 --> 01:00:10,626
That's the deal.

845
01:00:10,709 --> 01:00:11,918

848
01:00:19,543 --> 01:00:20,543
Can you ride him?

01:00:21,626 --> 01:00:23,293
[bennu screeches]

850
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:31,334
Yeah… I can ride him.

[roars]

01:00:33,584 --> 01:00:36,334

Don't let him fight you like that!

Drop your leads.

She'll tear you apart.

858
01:00:56,584 --> 01:00:59,459
Drop your leads and clear out now.

859
01:00:59,543 --> 01:01:01,793
Suit yourself. Drop them.

[bennu screeches]

See, you and I…

866

…we are alike.

867
01:01:33,376 --> 01:01:35,876
We've been hurt. Betrayed.

868

We both know fear.

Yet, the biggest fear we both face…

872
01:01:58,418 --> 01:02:00,918
…is the fear of ourselves.

Let's show them we're not afraid.

Let's show them we're more
than the shackles that bind us.

[woman] So, what's the job?

01:08:21,626 --> 01:08:25,209
We represent a village
on a small moon called Veldt.

933
01:08:26,584 --> 01:08:28,918
This village
faces the threat of annihilation

by the armies of the Motherworld.

I just want to talk. That's all.

I'm clearly distressed, that's true.

But I'm not stupid.

You want the child.

Yes, I do.

[Harmada] You can't have this one.

This one is mine.

She has a mother who's waiting for her.

Who's missing her.

955

And why should I care
about that mother's pain

It's poisoned my body.

960
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:27,709
It weakens my eggs,
and now, my children cannot emerge.

961
01:10:29,126 --> 01:10:30,584
I deserve justice.

962
01:10:31,376 --> 01:10:32,376
[Nemesis] I understand.

963
01:10:33,001 --> 01:10:34,709
But this is not the way.

964
01:10:35,834 --> 01:10:39,084
There is a difference
between justice and revenge.

965

Is there?

966

I'm not so sure.

is appreciated and I can assure you…

1128
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:38,418
…Devra is aware of your presence.

1129
01:24:39,084 --> 01:24:44,918
A decision when to receive you
is imminent.

1130
01:24:47,293 --> 01:24:51,084
Thank you, Levitica, honored king.

1131
01:24:55,126 --> 01:24:57,334
We await their arrival.

1132
01:25:07,543 --> 01:25:09,263
- [distant boom]
- [Gunnar in English] Look.

1133
01:25:09,334 --> 01:25:10,751
[Bloodaxe fleet approaches]

1134
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:16,209
[dramatic music plays]

1135
01:26:10,918 --> 01:26:15,834
Farmer, why would you contact us
from this unknown and flag less vessel?

1136
01:26:15,918 --> 01:26:20,001
I was assuming we had a level of trust
after our last meeting.

1137
01:26:20,084 --> 01:26:22,834
We bought your grain to feed our fighters.

1138
01:26:23,418 --> 01:26:27,584
Do not confuse your business of commerce
with our business of revolution.

1139
01:26:27,668 --> 01:26:29,168
[Gunnar] I understand.

1140
01:26:29,251 --> 01:26:33,501
Your coming here is a great risk
to us all and to our benefactor.

1141
01:26:33,584 --> 01:26:36,209
But we are no longer
in need of your grain.

1142
01:26:36,293 --> 01:26:39,334
King Levitica's kindness
has been more than enough to sustain us,

1143
01:26:39,418 --> 01:26:42,084
so I suggest you leave immediately.

1144
01:26:42,168 --> 01:26:44,001
[Kora] We're not here to sell grain.

1145
01:26:44,084 --> 01:26:46,126
Gunnar's village
was visited by a Dreadnought

1146
01:26:46,209 --> 01:26:48,251
that threatens its very existence.

1147
01:26:48,334 --> 01:26:49,918
I have recruited these warriors

1148
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:52,959
and given my word to bring them back
and defend the farmers.

1149
01:26:53,043 --> 01:26:55,334
- But we're running out of time.
- What?

1150
01:26:55,918 --> 01:26:58,668
This handful? Against a Dreadnought?

1151
01:26:58,751 --> 01:27:01,251
That's why we have come.
You have men and ships.

1152
01:27:02,001 --> 01:27:03,959
With you we could mount a real defense.

1153
01:27:04,043 --> 01:27:09,001
And, of course, we can pay you
with the surplus from our harvest.

1154
01:27:10,751 --> 01:27:11,918
It's all we've got.

1155
01:27:12,001 --> 01:27:14,168
[Devra] My forces against the King's Gaze?

1156
01:27:14,251 --> 01:27:15,293
That's suicide.

1157
01:27:15,876 --> 01:27:18,459
That ship cannot be destroyed
by a few dozen fighters.

1158
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:23,209
That ship and the men aboard it
are world destroyers.

1159
01:27:23,293 --> 01:27:25,626
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

1160
01:27:25,709 --> 01:27:27,876
[Kora] This man is not a revolutionary.

1161
01:27:27,959 --> 01:27:29,709
He's a simple farmer.

1162
01:27:29,793 --> 01:27:31,126
But commerce or not,

1163
01:27:31,209 --> 01:27:35,043
his people toiled with their bare hands
to grow the grain that fed you.

1164
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:36,126
All of you!

1165
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,584
And because of that transaction,

1166
01:27:38,668 --> 01:27:41,418
their village is now
threatened by Admiral Noble,

1167
01:27:41,501 --> 01:27:44,334
in pursuit of <i>your </i>revolution.

1168
01:27:47,959 --> 01:27:49,959
[suspenseful music plays]

1169
01:28:06,043 --> 01:28:07,043
I see.

1170
01:28:12,251 --> 01:28:13,251
I will go.

1171
01:28:15,459 --> 01:28:16,459
Thank you.

1172
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:18,709
Brother, a word.

1173
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:31,834
Our victories, what few there have been,
have been tactical ones.

1174
01:28:31,918 --> 01:28:34,168
We cannot fight in the open
against the King's Gaze.

1175
01:28:34,251 --> 01:28:38,084
If the farmer found us,
it won't be long before Noble does.

1176
01:28:38,834 --> 01:28:43,834
And I will not allow another world
to fall in our name.

1177
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:45,084
[Devra sighs]

1178
01:28:46,959 --> 01:28:48,626
And what of those you command?

1179
01:28:51,584 --> 01:28:53,126
[Darrian] Their lives are theirs.

1180
01:28:56,334 --> 01:28:57,543
[Devra] Hmm.

1181
01:29:10,709 --> 01:29:14,293
These people, they've come to us with

1182
01:29:15,084 --> 01:29:16,709
nowhere else to turn.

1183
01:29:17,793 --> 01:29:19,001
They come…

1184
01:29:19,668 --> 01:29:21,043
…seeking our help…

1185
01:29:22,126 --> 01:29:25,543
…to stand against
a Dreadnought of the Motherworld.

1186
01:29:27,043 --> 01:29:29,168
Is that not what we stand for?

1187
01:29:31,418 --> 01:29:34,751
Are they not who we once were?

1188
01:29:39,293 --> 01:29:42,751
If we will not stand with these
defiant farmers to protect their home,

1189
01:29:43,334 --> 01:29:45,793
then the revolution is meaningless.

1190
01:29:47,834 --> 01:29:48,918
Under free will,

1191
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:52,959
who among you
is willing to die for what we believe

1192
01:29:53,959 --> 01:29:55,751
rather than hide behind it?

1193
01:30:12,168 --> 01:30:13,251
[Darrian] Milius.

1194
01:30:14,584 --> 01:30:15,876
Why am I not surprised?

1195
01:30:16,459 --> 01:30:20,584
Who is going to make sure
you'll return in one piece, if not me?

1196
01:30:40,751 --> 01:30:43,418
Thank Levitica and leave this planet.

1197
01:30:46,334 --> 01:30:48,168
[Kai pats on back]

1198
01:30:48,251 --> 01:30:50,668
Sister, until we meet again.

1199
01:30:54,126 --> 01:30:55,251
[Darrian whistles]

1200
01:30:59,543 --> 01:31:01,418
Maybe this isn't suicide after all.

1201
01:31:03,334 --> 01:31:05,334
[ship engines blast]

1202
01:31:27,209 --> 01:31:28,876
Why would he agree to help you?

1203
01:31:29,876 --> 01:31:33,084
Bloodaxe? You think they shouldn't?

1204
01:31:35,709 --> 01:31:37,209
It just seems short-sighted.

1205
01:31:39,293 --> 01:31:41,168
I mean, he weakens what little of

1206
01:31:41,251 --> 01:31:43,626
whatever word
you wanna use for it there is…

1207
01:31:44,418 --> 01:31:46,376
Resistance, insurgency.

1208
01:31:47,334 --> 01:31:48,459
For what, Kora?

1209
01:31:50,418 --> 01:31:52,751
The chance to get obliterated
by a Dreadnought?

1210
01:31:53,293 --> 01:31:55,626
Guilt, it's a powerful thing.

1211
01:31:56,334 --> 01:31:59,459
[Kai] Aye, guilt. The underbelly of honor.

1212
01:32:00,751 --> 01:32:02,543
I think I might've had that once.

1213
01:32:03,834 --> 01:32:04,834
Honor.

1214
01:32:05,751 --> 01:32:07,001
Would you believe that?

1215
01:32:08,918 --> 01:32:09,918
It's true.

1216
01:32:12,001 --> 01:32:13,459
I mean, what do you figure?

1217
01:32:14,501 --> 01:32:19,959
I got ten, fifteen more seasons at most,
before I steal from the wrong man.

1218
01:32:20,543 --> 01:32:24,918
Get stabbed to death by some
dog-headed son of a bitch in a bar fight.

1219
01:32:25,001 --> 01:32:26,001
[Kora chuckles]

1220
01:32:27,543 --> 01:32:29,418
It's really your fault, anyway.

1221
01:32:30,501 --> 01:32:32,751
Makin' me wanna be an honorable man.

1222
01:32:33,668 --> 01:32:35,834
If you had more
resisting power to speak of,

1223
01:32:35,918 --> 01:32:38,084
you wouldn't need me to join you so badly.

1224
01:32:39,834 --> 01:32:41,459
You're willing to fight with us?

1225
01:32:42,418 --> 01:32:43,584
Since you're beggin'.

1226
01:32:44,834 --> 01:32:47,209
Kai, we're not.

1227
01:32:47,834 --> 01:32:49,334
Well, since you're asking, then.

1228
01:32:50,001 --> 01:32:51,251
If you'll allow me.

1229
01:32:51,959 --> 01:32:52,959
Wow.

1230
01:32:56,376 --> 01:32:57,834
There is one complication.

1231
01:32:58,501 --> 01:33:00,084
The shite in the cargo hold.

1232
01:33:00,876 --> 01:33:02,584
I got buyers waiting in Gondival.

1233
01:33:03,084 --> 01:33:05,501
Aren't the kinds known for their patience.

1234
01:33:05,584 --> 01:33:07,876
Might be wise
to sever my ties to life as a thief

1235
01:33:07,959 --> 01:33:10,459
before we go
picking a fight with a Dreadnought.

1236
01:33:11,043 --> 01:33:14,209
Besides, you said yourself you need me.

1237
01:33:16,168 --> 01:33:18,418
- I did not say that.
- I think you did.

1238
01:33:18,501 --> 01:33:20,834
I'll set the course
and let 'em know we're on our way.

1239
01:33:20,918 --> 01:33:23,334
Oh, shit, does that make me
one of the good guys?

[in English] Please!

1245

I've told you the truth.

1246
01:33:39,668 --> 01:33:41,501
I have nothing more.

1247
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:44,626
[Noble] Right.

1248
01:33:44,709 --> 01:33:46,001
[scoffs] The truth…

1249
01:33:47,376 --> 01:33:50,209
…that you took them in,
known enemies of the Motherworld,

1250
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:54,001
mended their wounds,
repaired their broken ships,

1251
01:33:54,084 --> 01:33:57,334
all out of your
moral code of honor and charity.

1252
01:33:57,418 --> 01:34:02,709
Our civilization has lived
and thrived for 10,000 years

1253
01:34:02,793 --> 01:34:07,793
with honor and charity
as its most valued tenets.

1254
01:34:07,876 --> 01:34:10,584
Yes. Yes, honor and charity.

1255
01:34:13,251 --> 01:34:14,251
Do you see that?

1256
01:34:17,543 --> 01:34:19,459
That ship is named the King's Gaze.

1257
01:34:20,251 --> 01:34:22,251
It was named to honor our slain father.

1258
01:34:25,293 --> 01:34:26,293
So…

1259
01:34:28,126 --> 01:34:29,459
Honor I understand.

1260
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:34,251
Charity, I do not.

1261
01:34:35,418 --> 01:34:38,418
Our King showed charity
to an off-worlder like yourself

1262
01:34:38,501 --> 01:34:40,376
and was slaughtered for his charity.

1263
01:34:41,084 --> 01:34:45,793
So, we named the ship to remind us
of the power in that benevolent gaze

1264
01:34:45,876 --> 01:34:48,293
that was lost to charity.

1265
01:34:49,626 --> 01:34:54,293
And to remember that, if by God's will,
that gaze should fall upon us and be held,

1266
01:34:55,793 --> 01:34:57,501
for even the briefest of moments,

1267
01:34:59,001 --> 01:35:01,001
it could change your life forever.

1268
01:35:03,084 --> 01:35:04,584
Today, it falls upon you.

[Cassius] Sir, we received a message
from one of our Hawkshaws.

1274
01:35:35,501 --> 01:35:37,626
They're closing in on the Bloodaxes.

1275

[Noble] Ah.

1276
01:35:40,918 --> 01:35:42,584
Finally, some good news.

1277

Well, prepare the hyperlaunch.

the treasonous dogs myself.

And what orders for the King's Gaze, sir?

1281

Well, once you've razed the planet,

1282
01:36:00,459 --> 01:36:04,334
we'll rendezvous, extract the exact
location of the rest of the insurgents,

1283
01:36:04,918 --> 01:36:06,876
and destroy them once and for all.

[Gunnar] I'm pretty sure
Kai said these boxes.

1290
01:37:02,834 --> 01:37:04,543
- [Titus] We've got one.
- [Gunnar] Okay.

1291
01:37:04,626 --> 01:37:06,043
Aye, just take the gray ones.

1292
01:37:06,126 --> 01:37:07,459
- They're all marked.
- All right.

1293
01:37:07,543 --> 01:37:11,126
For God's sake, don't look inside.
I'd hate you to think less of me.

Where do you want them?

1298
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:22,918
- There's space behind the bridge.
- Done.

1299
01:37:24,876 --> 01:37:26,876
All right, put them
the other side of the bridge.

1300
01:37:29,918 --> 01:37:32,543
Aye, let's unload
and get off this godforsaken rock.

1301
01:37:33,126 --> 01:37:35,001
I'll be happy to leave this life behind.

1302
01:37:35,668 --> 01:37:36,668
Good.

[indistinct announcement on PA]

Once you tie off those ships,
see if you can get some fuel.

1309
01:38:07,168 --> 01:38:10,834
And you two, keep eyes from above!

1329
01:39:58,418 --> 01:39:59,418
When?

1330
01:40:00,668 --> 01:40:04,459
[Kai] On Veldt, in Providence,
the first time I heard your story.

1331
01:40:05,459 --> 01:40:09,543
Thought with your ideals of resistance
I could round up a couple of heads.

1332
01:40:09,626 --> 01:40:11,376
Tarak for instance.

1333
01:40:12,126 --> 01:40:13,959
His world enslaved.

1334
01:40:15,209 --> 01:40:16,584
Then there was Nemesis.

1335
01:40:17,709 --> 01:40:19,334
Her whole family slaughtered.

1336
01:40:20,709 --> 01:40:22,293
But General Titus?

1337
01:40:23,334 --> 01:40:26,751
Have you any idea
how much he alone is worth?

1338
01:40:27,959 --> 01:40:29,543
They would've all jumped at the chance

1339
01:40:29,626 --> 01:40:31,959
to exact any small vengeance
against the Realm.

1340
01:40:33,334 --> 01:40:35,918
Even if the payment
was only a sack of grain.

1341
01:40:39,084 --> 01:40:42,334
Then there was you. Kora.

1342
01:40:43,959 --> 01:40:46,168
Or should I call you Arthelais?

1343
01:40:47,501 --> 01:40:49,626
The biggest prize of them all.

1344
01:40:51,834 --> 01:40:54,334
Do you know what
the Motherworld did to my planet?

1345
01:40:54,918 --> 01:40:57,043
They didn't just destroy it.

1346
01:40:58,793 --> 01:41:02,209
They tortured every man, woman, and child.

1347
01:41:04,084 --> 01:41:08,543
Left them clingin' to life
as they turned them to ash from low orbit.

1348
01:41:10,293 --> 01:41:11,834
You know what that taught me?

1349
01:41:13,293 --> 01:41:16,501
Never set foot
on the wrong side of history.

1350
01:41:16,584 --> 01:41:18,543
[Kora] Is that what you think we're doing?

1351
01:41:19,668 --> 01:41:20,668
[Kai] No.

1352
01:41:20,709 --> 01:41:24,168
You've chosen the side that
doesn't even make it to the history books.

1353
01:41:25,293 --> 01:41:26,793
What happened to honor?

1354
01:41:27,418 --> 01:41:29,043
What did happen to it?

1355
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:31,709
Piece of shit.

1356
01:41:39,709 --> 01:41:41,293
Well, who all have we got here?

1357
01:41:44,126 --> 01:41:45,126
Who indeed?

1358
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:47,834
Commander Bloodaxe.

1359
01:41:49,251 --> 01:41:50,626
Leader of the very insurgency

1360
01:41:50,709 --> 01:41:54,043
the King's Gaze was sent to
this backwater of the galaxy to capture.

1361
01:41:54,543 --> 01:41:56,876
He alone will secure
my seat in the Senate.

1362
01:41:58,376 --> 01:42:02,501
I would be remiss if I failed to mention
we are in the presence of royalty.

1363
01:42:03,584 --> 01:42:05,293
Tarak Decimus.

1364
01:42:05,376 --> 01:42:08,168
Or should I say Prince Tarak? [Scoffs]

1365
01:42:09,251 --> 01:42:10,251
General Titus.

1366
01:42:11,001 --> 01:42:12,751
Needs no introduction, does he?

1367
01:42:12,834 --> 01:42:16,001
His actions
at the Battle of Sarawu precede him.

1368
01:42:17,918 --> 01:42:19,043
The farmer.

1369
01:42:21,584 --> 01:42:22,918
The ambitious farmer.

1370
01:42:24,001 --> 01:42:26,376
I pride myself on never being surprised.

1371
01:42:27,251 --> 01:42:28,418
And yet, here I am.

1372
01:42:29,876 --> 01:42:33,501
I understand
why all of them are here… but you.

1373
01:42:34,793 --> 01:42:39,293
What could you have possibly hoped to gain
by mounting such a… feeble stand?

1374
01:42:40,334 --> 01:42:41,334
Tell me.

1375
01:42:45,209 --> 01:42:46,459
Oh, yes.

1376
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:57,584
The legendary swords woman
known only by the name of Nemesis.

1377
01:42:58,959 --> 01:43:02,251
Assassinated 16 high-ranking
Imperial officers

1378
01:43:02,334 --> 01:43:04,043
and their security details.

1379
01:43:05,168 --> 01:43:08,959
All in a hunt
to avenge her slaughtered children.

1380
01:43:09,876 --> 01:43:10,876
Oh…

1381
01:43:31,751 --> 01:43:32,751
[Noble] Of course.

[gun clatters]

1383
01:43:36,751 --> 01:43:38,834
Now I thought I recognized
something in you,

1384
01:43:39,543 --> 01:43:40,834
down in that filthy village.

1385
01:43:41,501 --> 01:43:43,376
Out there,
amongst all those simple people,

1386
01:43:45,251 --> 01:43:48,043
the most wanted fugitive
in the known universe.

1387
01:43:50,126 --> 01:43:53,501
Scargiver. Arthelais.

1388
01:43:54,126 --> 01:43:57,376
Do you know what you've
done for me, Arthelais, truly?

1389
01:43:58,626 --> 01:44:00,293
Assembling yourself as such?

1390
01:44:01,959 --> 01:44:04,209
When I lay your bodies
at the foot of the Regent,

1391
01:44:04,876 --> 01:44:06,751
I'll be a hero of the Realm.

1392
01:44:07,334 --> 01:44:09,334
They'll write songs
of my feats of courage.

1393
01:44:10,543 --> 01:44:12,334
It's not like I didn't do all the work.

1394
01:44:13,751 --> 01:44:15,459
Let's move this along, shall we?

1395
01:44:15,543 --> 01:44:19,293
Let's transport them paralyzed,
in case anyone's feeling frisky.

1396
01:44:20,584 --> 01:44:22,918
On your feet. I've got a job for you.

You're sick.

1402
01:44:46,751 --> 01:44:48,084
And you're a coward.

1403
01:44:53,459 --> 01:44:55,626
[Kai] All you have to do
is pull the trigger.

1404
01:44:57,876 --> 01:44:58,918
[Gunnar] I won't do it.

1405
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:00,251
[Kai] Yes, you will.

1406
01:45:02,959 --> 01:45:05,959

They believed in their cause.

What better thing to die for?

1471

And I should have died with them.

1472
01:55:07,001 --> 01:55:09,626
I know a thing or two about

1473

the guilt of carrying on when those
you've sworn to fight with are gone.

Honor them.

Criminals, nobodies,
standing against a machine of war.

This small act of defiance
gives voice to the voiceless.

1482
01:56:06,709 --> 01:56:11,126
This is more than just a fallen
prick officer and some of his men.

It's the beginning of something.

What will they do now?

After the death of an admiral,

That's good.

I owe you thanks, Gunnar.
You know, I never did trust that pilot.

[Kora] We all owe him thanks.

01:57:43,918 --> 01:57:46,334
Is what that dead bounty hunter said true?

1497
01:57:47,043 --> 01:57:48,959
That you're Arthelais?

1498
01:57:50,084 --> 01:57:53,251
Kai was a liar and a thief
who nearly sold you all for a profit.

Anything more you want, General?

Don't call me General.

It's almost a shame
you killed that son-of-a-bitch Noble

01:58:22,001 --> 01:58:23,376
and we don't have to fight.

1509

This would've been
a beautiful place to die.

Yes, it would.

- You're certain it's her?
- I am, my Lord.

She was in the company of the disgraced
General Titus and Darrian Bloodaxe.

1534
02:01:59,334 --> 02:02:01,126
We are close to capturing them.

Tell me, Commander. Did you think
that this would be good news?

That my daughter, Arthelais,

one of the most dangerous
and decorated warriors

in the history of armed conflict,
is now part of a blossoming insurgency?

I'm supposed to be happy

1540

that she's joined forces with the genius
battlefield commander, General Titus?

1541
02:02:28,459 --> 02:02:30,084
Sir, she is within our grasp.

1542
02:02:32,168 --> 02:02:33,584

[Balisarius] In truth, I fear the head
most endangered here is yours.

1546
02:02:45,584 --> 02:02:49,543
You will crush this insurgency
to the last man, do you hear me?

1547
02:02:50,918 --> 02:02:53,418
And then you will capture
my daughter alive

1548
02:02:54,293 --> 02:02:56,876
and bring back my precious child to me.

1549
02:03:00,043 --> 02:03:03,251
So that I may crucify her
in the shadow of the Senate.

1550
02:03:03,834 --> 02:03:05,584
If you cannot bring her to me,

1551
02:03:07,126 --> 02:03:09,168
then the one whose public execution

1552
02:03:09,251 --> 02:03:12,293
will send shivers
down the spines of the senators,

1553
02:03:12,959 --> 02:03:17,126
and whose screams
will echo down its marbled halls

1554
02:03:18,418 --> 02:03:19,584
will be yours.
