1
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,840
Hey, there.
Sorry to bother you, folks,

2
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,230
but, uh, we're looking
for an individual.

3
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,060
Golden-brown complexion.

4
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,500
15 pounds.

5
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,800
No head.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,540
I know where he is.

7
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,890
I'll even serve him up
on a silver platter for you.

8
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,720
Now get in here.

9
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,510
I'm glad to see you finally
out of your man cave.

10
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,380
Well, you know, Amanda
can be pretty convincing

11
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,250
when she wants to be.Hey, babe. Eric's here.

12
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,990
Hey, Amanda.

13
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,820
Well, well, well, well.

14
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,990
You made it.Yeah.

15
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,390
Sorry.

16
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,520
Thomas. One second.

17
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,690
I baked this for you.
I couldn't eat it by myself.

18
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,090
It would just be too depressing.

19
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,480
Wow.

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,960
You baked this?

21
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,140
Yeah, you know,
for a single guy,

22
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,010
I know my way around the oven.

23
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,970
Ah... A guy in uniform
who knows how to bake.

24
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,100
I have a feeling you're not
gonna be single for long.

25
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,840
Come on. You remember my mom,
right?

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,410
Hey, Mom, remember Eric?WOMAN: Oh, hey.

27
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,060
Happy Thanksgiving.

28
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,630
Uh, do you want any or...?: No, no.

29
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,110
Jeans and a sweater?

30
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,500
You could at least
make an effort.

31
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,030
Casual's more my thing,
Kathleen.

32
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,770
Especially in my own house.

33
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,030
Don't you mean "our house" now?

34
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,250
Hey, hey, hey, hey.JESSICA: Hi, Dad.

35
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,730
Happy Thanksgiving.

36
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,340
Oh, thank God you're back,
Thomas.

37
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,690
Thought we'd be eating
a frozen turkey dinner.

38
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,880
This guy.

39
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,130
Sorry, Rob.
Yeah, this is the first time

40
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,960
the store's open
on Thanksgiving.

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,570
You know, we always do the,
uh, midnight Black Friday,

42
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,570
but people were showing up
at 6:00 p.m. anyway, so...

43
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,270
And you're a smart man, Thomas.

44
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,700
Yeah, well, credit my beautiful
fiancée over there.

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,050
It was her idea.

46
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,450
Well, from what
I've been hearing

47
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,970
about the turnout,
it is going to be

48
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,970
a very happy Thanksgiving.

49
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,630
Here we go.

50
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,890
Oh, that's beautiful. Yes.

51
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,590
Mitch, we need
your carving skills.

52
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,590
I've got time to carve it
but not to eat it.

53
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,030
Oh, what?Thomas is not making you work.

54
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,200
Blame Bob.
Apparently, he's AWOL.

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,770
Thomas called and said
it's me working or I'm fired.

56
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,510
Oh, sorry,buddy.

57
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,470
Aw! The store shouldn't
even be open.

58
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,170
It's Thanksgiving.

59
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,860
I know, Mary,
but let's face it.

60
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,780
Black Friday starts
on a Thursday now.

61
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,870
Even in Plymouth.

62
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,310
Hey, Bon Jovi,
why don't you get to the back

63
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,790
of the fucking line, okay?Yeah, suck my dick!

64
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,830
We were here first.

65
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,440
Hey, everybody.

66
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,270
Just fucking calm down.

67
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,230
Two hits. I hit you,
you hit the ground, kid!

68
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,010
What the fuck?!

69
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,230
Jesus, everybody, be patient!LONNIE: Hey, fuck you!

70
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,970
Let us in, or you'll be
a patient in Mass General.

71
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,450
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

72
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,540
Fucking funny, eh?

73
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,020
The store opens in ten minutes.

74
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,020
You'll get your waffle iron!

75
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,980
Xanax?No, you got a fire hose?

76
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,900
Todd,

77
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,740
I need you at the register.

78
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,780
Thank you.

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,100
Bunch of goddamn morons.

80
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,750
When Kathleen sold my dad
this house,

81
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,970
I didn't realize
she was coming with it.

82
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,030
She'll never be able
to replace your mom, Jess.

83
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,680
Yeah.

84
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,410
And look at it this way.

85
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,200
It was a quick engagement,

86
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,380
so hopefully it'll be
a quick divorce.

87
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,120
Please, God.

88
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,650
Oh. Let's go.

89
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,300
Dad, we're going to the movies.Have fun. Uh, Bobby,

90
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,910
I want to hear about
that 19-strikeout game

91
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,180
against UCLA, when you get back.

92
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,050
Deal, Thomas.
Good night, everyone.

93
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,180
Scuba invited Yulia.
He's into her.

94
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,790
Got it. I'll gas him up.

95
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,360
Okay.

96
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,750
Bobby.
Bobby Boucher.

97
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,450
Bobby "Golden Arm"
home for Thanksgiving,

98
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,970
and my ride or die, J-Money.What up, dawg?

99
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,580
I heard you're
the new Friday Night guy.

100
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,890
Ah, I'd better be, with
a 96-mile-per-hour fastball.

101
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,860
Evan, you are such a dick.What?

102
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,370
Yo, nice job beating Hanover.

103
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,940
Scuba, I heard
you were unstoppable.

104
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,250
Thanks, man.
It was a pretty good night

105
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,550
until Tyson Fury over here

106
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,120
almost got us
locked the fuck up.

107
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,820
Classic Evan.JESSICA: Why? What happened?

108
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,560
We got in a run-in with
some drunk Hanover assholes.

109
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,120
Fuck Hanover.I popped one of them

110
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,910
in the eye,
but this one was too busy

111
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,610
filming herself
to get some fucking footage.

112
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,390
Shit would've
broke the Internets.

113
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,570
You are lucky
I didn't film that, okay?

114
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,130
It was, like,
Waffle House-level cringe.

115
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,090
It was bad.

116

117
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,230

120

This fucking traffic
is ridiculous.

Oh, I can't handle
this shit.

Pit stop. I need a new phone.

124
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,590
Mine got fucking smashed
in the fight.

125
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,680
We're not going to the store.
It's a zoo.

Whoa, no, no, no, yes, we are,

127
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,510

a new lipstick.

You can't park your car here.

It's not a car, it's an SUV.

Hey, one-one second.
I'll be right back.

149

Hey, man. What's up?Yo.

150

Yeah, you and me both.

Um, sorry, Ryan, I-I have to

160
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,660
catch up with my friends.Oh, I'll walk you.

Come on. Come on.

162
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,570

Amanda, look at me.

323
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,070
Amanda.

324
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,120
Somebody help me!

325
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,860
Please help me!

326
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,120
Oh, my God.

327
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,870
Oh! Oh, fuck!

328
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,570
Stop!

329
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,800
Evan, get the fuck down!

330
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,410
This is fucking gold.You suck!

331
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,720
Evan, help me!

332
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,460
Evan, help me! Get the...

333
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,770
- Oh, my God. Holy shit.
- What the fuck?

334
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,860
That was crazy.Evan, get the fuck down.

335
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,870
I've never fucking seen
something like this in my life.

336
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,260
It's Thanksgiving,
not Thanksbuying!

337
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm live here at Right Mart

338
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,090
and although
the store has announced

339
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,790
they will have substantial
security upgrades

340
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,710
for Thanksgiving,

341
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,280
many residents feel after last
year's catastrophic events,

342
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,100
the store shouldn't
be open at all.

343
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,590
Thomas Wright,
you and your entire family

344
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,020
have blood on your hands.

345
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,070
My wife's blood.

346
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,510
We open for Thanksgiving, you
only hire two security guards?

347
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,990
One of whom runs away and
the other is trampled to death

348
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,730
in the same stampede
that killed my wife.

349
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,990
You and your entire family
need to go to prison.

350
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,520
Not have another sale!

351
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,210
Right Mart owner,
Thomas Wright,

352
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,480
has worked overtime
since last year

353
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,780
to give back to the community,

354
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,960
restoring Plymouth Park
and even going so far

355
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,220
as to start
the Wright Family Foundation,

356
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,270
sending local kids to college.

357
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,400
But many say it's not enough.

358
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,970
Local pitching phenom
Bobby Di Stasi

359
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,190
suffered a career-ending injury

360
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,150
and has not been heard from
since the accident.

361
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,150
Many lawsuits were filed
and settled,

362
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,980
but the security cameras
somehow weren't working

363
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,850
the night of the tragedy.

364
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,200
All I know is the cameras
were functioning perfectly fine

365
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,640
when I arrived.

366
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,290
Then they mysteriously
stopped working

367
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,600
the one night there's an actual
disaster at the store.

368
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,120
How convenient.

369
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,300
Thanks, Mitch.

370
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,990
Reporting live, Hank Morton

371
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,950
at the Right Mart
in downtown Plymouth.

372
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,560
Chet, Natalie, back to you.

373
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,910
And here you go.

374
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,830
Happy Thanksgiving.Yeah.

375
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,440
Good morning, Sheriff.
You want the usual?

376
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,230
Two cups today, Lizzie.
New deputy's coming.

377
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,660
Oh, well,
he was in here yesterday

378
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,970
and, uh, he's not much
for conversation.

379
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,500
Yeah.A real charmer.

380
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,110
Probably just overwhelmed

381
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,190
by the thriving metropolis
that is Plymouth.

382

♪ Whoa, oh, oh, chills... ♪

383
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,120
What the fuck?

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,040
Fuck you.

385
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,080
This fish.It's organic.

386
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,470
Oh, you know, all the lobsters
from the north...

387
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,040
Here he is. Good morning.

388
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,300
Good morning, Sheriff.Welcome.

389
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,650
And here you are.

390
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,920
It's John Carver.
He was the first...

391
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,220
First governor
of New Plymouth colony.

392
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,140
Look at you. You've been doing
your homework there, Labelle.

393
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,450
Well, if you call reading
a plaque on a statue homework.

394
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,840
Oh, now, come on,
show some enthusiasm.

395
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,970
Thanksgiving
is an institution here.

396
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,450
What kid wouldn't want
to wear that, right?

397
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,930
Yeah, get used to it.

398
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,860
Everybody's
gonna be wearing them.

399
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,110
Yeah. I can get used to it.

400
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,350
♪ But then I bury
the hatchet. ♪

401
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,870
Yes!

402
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,920
Let's go.

403
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,730
What-what are you doing?

404
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,000
Kid, what are you doing?

405
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,520
I just hit top two rungs.

406
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,480
That means you get to go again.

407
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,220
Somebody keeps tagging me
in the video.

408
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah, they're tagging me, too.

409
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,700
God. I'm gonna report it.

410
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,440
Yeah, but people
keep reposting it.

411
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,830
You think someone's doing
it on purpose?

412
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,310
Dude, I just won
this candy apple.

413
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,840
I hit the bull's-eye
like three times in a row.

414
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,580
Awesome.
Good job, babe.

415
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,930
What?

416
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,580
What is it?
What did I do now?

417
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,020
Evan,
get the fuck down!This.

418
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,410
This is fucking gold.

419
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,320
I thought we were past this.Yeah, so did I.

420
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,800
Well, fuck this.
I'm going back to the axe pit.

421
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,800
It's safer there.

422
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,500
Ev, I'm sorry.

423
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,200
I wasn't the only one
with a phone that night.

424
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,370
I know you didn't post it.

425
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,940
Come on, come on.

426
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,990
Ugh.
I have to go
to the John Carver house

427
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,120
to film that stupid commercial
with my dad.

428
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,300
I'm making
my grandmother's stuffing.

429
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,340
Her secret ingredient
was a touch of eggplant.

430
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,300
I only hope I can make it
half as good as hers, though.

431
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,130
Oh, I'm sure you'll make
an excellent dinner, Kathleen.

432
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,700
Hey, Jessica.Hey.

433
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,740
So, you ready for your
big moment in the limelight?

434
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,140
Oh, yeah. Already wrote
my acceptance speech.

435
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,790
Ah, I have mine ready, too.

436
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,620
Yours?

437
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,050
Didn't your father tell you?

438
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,550
He wants a family commercial
this year.

439
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,760
Look at it this way:
One more year until college.

440
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,150
How am I supposed to have
an answer? I don't...

441
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,720
I can't fucking believe this!

442
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,550
I don't have an answer, Stan.
I have no idea

443
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,940
what in the hell just happened.Huh.

444
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,550
Don't know what he's doing.

445
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,770
It's now just
a complete disaster.

446
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,390
What's going on?You got to see this.

447
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,950
This is a fucking disaster.

448
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,610
The whole commercial's ruined.

449
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,130
I've been screaming
at everybody the whole morning.

450
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,570
Okay, guys, back up.
I got to call this in.

451
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, a historical landmark
has been trashed.

452
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,270
What?

453
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,570
Yeah, whatever.
That, too.

454
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,790
I got to shut this place down.

455
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,140
I catch these guys,

456
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,490
I'm gonna prosecute them
for vandalism.

457
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,320
Uh, yeah, and theft.

458
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,320
Because there was an axe
on that wall I was gonna use.

459
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,840
It's gone.

460
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,150
Come to Right Mart,
where we slash prices...

461
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,540
without a fucking axe!

462
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,340
My commercial's ruined.

463
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,110
You look relieved.

464
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,900
Yeah.

465
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,330
I'm tired of pretending

466
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,380
like everything's normal
when it's not.

467
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,300
Well, hey, Jess, I want things
to go back to normal, too.

468
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,600
That's why this year's
gonna be everything

469
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,080
last year was supposed to be.

470
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,690
Dad...

471
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,170
Having another sale
like nothing happened

472
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,300
doesn't change anything.
It just ignores it.

473
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,060
And as usual, we can't have
one moment alone.

474
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,280
Hey.Hey.

475
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,680
I'm good. Very good.

476
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,840
How are things going
with Jessica?

477
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,540
Dude, they're amazing.

478
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,070
She invited me to the parade
to be on the float,

479
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,630
and then I scored an invite
to Thanksgiving dinner

480
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,850
with her family at her house.
I feel like I'm in.

481
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,160
Bobby ghosting her is the best
thing that ever happened to me.

482
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,420
Nicely played.

483

That is where you want to be.

486
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,740
You look like you enjoy alcohol
and drinking,

487
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,440
so you're gonna want to come
down to the McCarty party.

25 whole dollars. Hey.

489
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,350
You guys want tickets
to McCarty Party?

490
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,660
I can do a group rate.

491
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,180
He's charging this year?Yeah.

492
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,440
He's been watching
a lot of "Shark Tank."

493
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,710
Dude thinks he's Mark Cuban.

494
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,400
No, thank you.

495
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,580
Selling alcohol to teens
isn't exactly disrupting.

496
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,410
No, but it is
a recession-proof business.

497
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,800
Let me know
if you guys want tickets.

498
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,240
They're selling out quick.How about you

499
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,670
finish my fucking history paper,

500
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,550
and then we'll talk tickets?

501
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,850
Sure.SCUBA: You're an asshole.

502
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,850
You're such... Be nicer to him.

503
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,600
Listen, listen.GABY: He's a sweetie.

504
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,730
Gabs.EVAN: I paid him

505
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,640
a pretty decent sum of money.

506
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,080
What? I can't write papers and
play football at the same time.

507
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,170
Are you kidding?It's Bobby.

508
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,650
Oh, shit. He's back.

509
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,690
Wait, why didn't he come talk
to you?

510
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,830
I don't know. I haven't talked
to him in, like, a year.

511
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,780
Yeah, that's definitely him.

512
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,440

Okay? Ryan's fine.

525
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,680
He just...

526
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,460
He's harmless, like an NPC.

528
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,860
he messes with
the group dynamic.

529
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,340
Okay.GABY: Just be nicer.

530
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,820
For me.Okay. I just have nothing

531
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,340
to talk about with the guy.

532
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,520

He's kind of boring.

533
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,040
Well, maybe if you made
a bit of an effort.

534
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,480
I mean, he's a good guy.

535
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,960
Good guy.

536
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,350
Well, he hasn't just ghosted me
yet, so...

537
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,610
he's frontrunner.

You finish your paper?

546
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,060
Barely.

547
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,930
I had to start another one
today, and I got...

548
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,890
I'm gonna just... I'm gonna be
swamped until Christmas,

let's just say that.

550

That's crazy, bro.

551
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,460
Oh, excuse me.
We're ready to order.

552
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,640
This isn't Right Mart, honey.

553
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,130
You actually have
to wait your turn here.

554

- That sounds fun.
- You can totally do that.

560
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,960
Or...

561
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,700
you could watch it with me
on the 50-yard line.

562
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,480
Wait.SCUBA: What's up? Yo.

571
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,940
Yes. Uh, can I do
the vanilla frappe?

572
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,550
All right. You want jimmies
on it?
Extra jimmies.

Garlic knots for the table?

574
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,820
Garlic knots.This isn't Papa Gino's, kids.

Fuck. No. No!

578
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,930
Where are my fucking keys?

579
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:22,280
Where are my fucking keys,
goddamn it?!

580
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,540
Fuck.

581

Fuck.

582
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,200
Motherfucker!

583
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,530
Watch out. Here we go.
Here we go. Watch out, sir.

584
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,530
Oh, my God.

585
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,220

590
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,650
I had a late night.Huh.

591
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,730
What were you doing?

592
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,560
Well, I had two essays to write.

593
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,260
I'll hook you up next week.

594
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,910
You said that last month.

595
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,790

eat this shit up, okay?

609
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,520
Stay behind the line.

610
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,300
Oh, Sheriff, what happened?
Is this killing connected

611
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,870
to what happened at Right Mart?

612
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,610
Can we get this pushed back
a little bit?

613
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,610
Am I walking on anything?
What do you got for me?

614
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,490
Guys are going through
security footage inside.

615
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,880
Inside?Sheriff.

616
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,180
Sheriff, can you tell us
anything...

617
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,590
Can you get these guys
out of the way?

618
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,140
Pete.

619
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,410
We found this where
the killer broke in.

620
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,150
What is this?

621
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,800
I think it's brick.

622
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,500
Or pieces of brick.Right.

623
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,200
Labelle, you've met
Detective Chu, yeah?

624
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,940
Oh, yeah.

625
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,720
Yeah, we met.

626
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,520
Come take a look at this.

627
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,470
Brick.

628
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,380
We got the killer
on security cam,

629
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,380
and you're not gonna believe
what he's wearing.

630
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,600
Cameras at Right Mart
caught the same guy

631
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,080
lowering her legs
onto the sign from the roof.

632
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,740
It's just like you said,
Sheriff.

633
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,090
Everyone in town's
wearing them.
Yeah.

634
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,790
Jess, you know me.

635
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,620
I will not be bullied
by some freaking lunatic.

636
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,400
The store is staying open,
and I'm hiring extra security.

637
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,140
But, honey, I need you to get to
the sheriff's office now.

638
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,880
I know. We're going now.Okay, but just ask anyone

639
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,190
who was there that night
to go talk to them.

640
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,890
Okay, okay. Bye.I love you.

641
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,630
He's hiring additional security.

642
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,020
But not closing the store.

643
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,890
Correct.
That would make sense.

644
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,330
Wait. Wait,
are you serious?

645
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,810
Did your dad not see
this guy tagged us?

646
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,380
Is he waiting for us
to be on a fucking display

647
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,290
in front of his store?I'm asking him right now.

648
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,810
Why?Scuba, don't.

649
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,600
Why the fuck not?
He gonna tag me,

650
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,470
I'm gonna send that motherfucker
a DM. Come get me, bitch.

651
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,080
Don't slide
into the killer's DMs.

652
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,210
Scuba, please,
just hold off, okay?

653
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,910
It's a murder case
in my dad's store.

654
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,610
We can't just fuck around.Fuck around and find out.

655
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,700
Fuck around and find out.SCUBA: That's right.

656
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,840
He'll see
what happens.

657
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,010
Are you crazy, McCarty?Come on, princess.

658
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,400
I wouldn't hit you.

659
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,710
You know how much paperwork
the cops

660
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,320
would make me fill out?

661
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,760
McCarty, are you back
to finish tenth grade?

662
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,190
I just thought, you know,

663
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,800
in light of the current
situation,

664
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,720
you might want
a little "protection."

665
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,330
Courtesy of my old man's store.

666
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,890
McCarty, only you
would have the balls

667
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,460
to sell guns
at a high school.

668
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,200
I should kick your ass right
here.

669
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,860
Come on, Mark Cuban would
think I'm a fucking genius:

670
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,640
Everyone gets a gun,
problem solved.

671
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, Scooby snacks.

672
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,600
Jesus, I'm only kidding.

673
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,950
I wouldn't sell guns to kids.

674
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,610
I'm selling alcohol.

675
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,520
And right now I gotta meet
that little farthead Jacob

676
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,480
to sell him some more
McCarty Party tickets.

677
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,790
All right, McCarty.Okay.

678
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,310
Sales are going
through the roof.

679
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,880
Fuck off, McCarty.No one's coming to that.

680
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,570
You guys should comeYULIA: You're a creep.

681
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,360
It's the only place in town
you won't get killed.

682
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,380
I could really use
your help, Jessica.

683
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,670
Uh, okay, what can I do?

684
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,370
We've exhausted
pretty much every resource

685
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,370
to identify people, but anyone

686
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,780
involved with that night
could be in serious danger.

687
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,260
I knew I shouldn't have
let them in the store.

688
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,470
Detective, can you
give us a moment?
Yes.

689
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,260
If you look closely,
you can see all our names.

690
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,180
And-and then it's kind
of blurry, it says "Scuba."

691
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,170
Why do they call you Scuba?

692
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,960
My last name's Dybing.

693
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,530
What's your first name?

694
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,090
Claude.

695
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,840
Yeah, Scuba's better.

696
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,710
Jessica, you know,
I don't know what happened

697
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,190
with those cameras last year,

698
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,060
but at this point,
I don't care.

699
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:26,320
Because I understand you're
in a difficult situation.

700
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,460
But I know you want
to do the right thing.

701
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,290
So if you know something,
anything that can help us

702
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,290
with the information
on that night,

703
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,650
I promise I'll keep it
between us.

704
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,780
Because this is a matter
of life and death.

705
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,450
Jess.

706
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,660
Saw you at the Cap yesterday.

707
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,630
No. I got in this morning.

708
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,970
You working for your uncle
again?

709
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,900
I'm helping out
while I'm in town.

710
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,980
Well, I'm sure
I'll see you around.

711
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,110
Hey, Jess, wait.

712
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,780
I'm sorry.

713
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,960
Can I walk with you?

714
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,260
I mean, you ghosted me.

715
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,610
You're off social media.

716
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,910
You deleted every trace
of yourself.

717
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,570
I ghosted everybody.

718
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,350
Yeah, but I'm not everybody.
I was your girlfriend.

719
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,700
I blamed you for
what happened to me,

720
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,350
and instead of just
telling you about it,

721
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,880
I vanished, like a dick.

722
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,100
I feel so stupid now,
but I just...

723
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,970
Bobby, I feel horrible.

724
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,970
If I hadn't let you guys in...No, don't.

725
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,580
Don't.
It-it was my decision.

726
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,160
I could have
stayed outside.

727
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,110
It's not your fault.

728
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,160
How's your arm?

729
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,070
I mean,
rehab's going great,

730
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,990
so I might get back up to
full-speed pitching again.

731
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,900
Golden Arm.Yeah.

732
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,960
That's good.
I'm happy to hear it.

733
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,260
Hey. What is it?

734
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,910
Nothing.

735
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,100
You know, I'm still your friend.
You can trust me.

736
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,960
That night,
after the trampling,

737
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,490
Kathleen was in a panic,
ranting about

738
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,620
bad publicity
and getting sued, and...

739
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:34,060
she went into the security room
and deleted all the footage.

740
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,670
She asked me not
to say anything,

741
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,590
and I didn't stop her.

742
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,540
There's nothing you can
do about it now, so...

743
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,760
That's the thing.
Maybe there is.

744
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,030
Look, there's a backup system
at my house

745
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,200
in my dad's office.

746
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,340
Jess, that's probably long gone.

747
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,210
No, it stores the footage
for a year.

748
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,990
Then tell your dad you need it,
and then,

749
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,210
given the circumstances,

750
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,250
he prob...No, no, no, no.

751
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,650
With the lawsuits, no way.

752
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,340
He's pretending like
it doesn't exist.

753
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,350
Well, what do you want to do?

754
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,400
I want to see what's on it.

755
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,220
Thanks for talking.

756
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,180
Yeah. It was really nice.

757
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,620
Oh, no, don't turn around.
It's Ryan Baker.

758
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,270
I'll get rid of him.

759
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,230
Hi, babe.Hi.

760
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,800
How you doing? All right?Yeah, yeah, fine.

761
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,670
Did you, um,
give your statement?

762
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,450
Yeah, I did, but they were
just looking to

763
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,280
identify people, and I didn't
know anybody except Scott,

764
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,980
so I didn't have much
to offer.

765
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,260
How you doing,
Bobby?

766
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,810
Well, I'm sorry to
break up this reunion,

767
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,340
but, uh, Bobby, could I see you
in my office?

768
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,820
This is new.

769
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,860
Yep. A lot's changed
since you left.

770
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,310
Looks like it.

771
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,140
All right,
let's get out of here.

772
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,790
Still no suspects

773
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,790
in the brutal murder of
local waitress Lizzie McMullan.

774
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,570
Authorities have no clues
other than cryptic

775
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,230
social media posts,

776
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,230
leaving many residents to wonder

777
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,990
who will be the next victim
of John Carver.

778
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,240
Hey, Dewey.

779
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,720
Hey, buddy, Daddy's going
on a little vacation.

780
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,810
All right? Going down to
the Dominican Republic,

781
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,420
and Gina's gonna
come down her, all right.

782
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,810
You just chill, buddy.

783
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,690
Who the fuck is...

784
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,380
Hey. Yeah.

785
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,650
I'm waiting.Yeah, man, I see you.

786
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,340
I got a fucking flight.
I'll be there in a minute.

787
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,300
All right?

788
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,700
Jesus.

789
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,570
All right, buddy.

790
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,240
Fuck.

791
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,380
Fuckin' passport.

792
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
Fuck.

793
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,780
Fuck.

794
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,990
Jesus fucking Christ.

795
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,500
Fuck.

796
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,170
Show yourself!

797
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,820
I'm a security guard.

798
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,360
I kill people every fucking day!

799
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,540
Hey, I'm not scared
of you, buddy.

800
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,930
Don't fuck with me!

801
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,420
Let's fuckin' go!

802
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,840
Dewey. Dewey where is he?
Where is he?

803
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,340
Tell Daddy where he is, Dewey.

804
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,500
Is he that way?

805
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,530
Night, Mom.

806
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,140
Our killer has claimed
a second victim.

807
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,010
He's brazen, confident.

808
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,270
He's spent a considerable
amount of time and energy

809
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,410
setting this up, but none
of this works unless he has

810
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,020
a private location where
he's taking the victims.

811
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,190
He's powering off his phone

812
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,370
so we can't track him
on the move.

813
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,980
He's taking the picture

814
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,280
and then uploading it
from another location.

815
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,070
We have one bit of physical
evidence that leads us

816
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,470
to Cordage Park.

817
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,770
Effective immediately,

818
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,910
we're searching
every inch of it.

819
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,950
Hey.Oh, hi, Dad.

820
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,700
I was just using your computer.Oh, it's fine. Listen...

821
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,130
I've been thinking
a lot about what you said.

822
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,920
You know, after Mom died,

823
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,920
the only thing that I
could do to survive was work.

824
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,750
Because it's all I know.

825
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,100
But work...

826
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,100
doesn't fill the void.

827
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,490
So, when I met Kathleen,

828
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,890
I felt alive again.
I was...

829
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,320
willing to just
overlook all flaws

830
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,540
and it might've...

831
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,120
been at your expense.

832
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,170
And I just want to say...

833
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,910
I'm sorry.

834
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,920
Thank you.

835
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,820
Love you, Dad.

836
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,400
Love you.

837
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,740
You find anything?

838
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,570
Yeah. Let's go.

839
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,740
Wait, what is it?

840
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,630
Nothing. Let's just go.

841
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,710
I know this kid.

842
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,270
Lionel. He goes to our school.

843
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,230
He's always the turkey
in the parade.

844
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,150
And I-I know that guy.

845
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,710
He goes to Hanover South.

846
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,190
Evan punched him, remember?JESSICA: Yeah,

847
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,720
he's the one
who started the riot.

848
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,240
He had the bullhorn.

849
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,720
I think his name is...

850
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,980
Larry? Or Lonnie?

851
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,380
Or-Or something.

852
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,330
And she's probably
a cheerleader.

853
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,210
That's great, Bobby. Thank you.

854
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,790
Yeah.

855
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,570
Hey, w-what is it?

856
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,400
There's one more.

857
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,880
That's Ryan Baker.

858
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,320
He didn't know anyone
other than his roommate, huh?

859
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,840
And that's Doug.

860
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,710
The guard that got
crushed to death.

861
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,970
Jessica, did Ryan ever mention
to you that he knew Doug?

862
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:19,330
Because that certainly
wasn't in his statement.

863
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,510
No.

864
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,110
Yeah.

865
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,390
There may not be anything to it.

866
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,120
Be careful who you trust.
Both of you.

867
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,640
Yeah, don't worry.

868
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,030
I'll take care of Ryan today.

869
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,300
You're not taking care
of anything.

870
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,430
He just said
it could be nothing.

871
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,120
All right, fine, Jess.

872
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,520
If I see Ryan, I'll act
like nothing's weird.

873
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,750
For you.

874
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,040
You should get back to school.

875
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,650
But stay alert.

876
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,790
That's why I won't be
celebrating Thanksgiving

877
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:49,280
this year or any year.

878
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,580
You're so brave.So brave.

879
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,970
Thank you, Chad.

880
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,320
That was very inspiring.

881
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,730
Next up...

882
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,460
Mr. Fletcher.

883
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,850
Let's go, Fletcher.

884
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,890
All right.

885
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,380
Um...

886
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,940
the piece that I have written...

887
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,250
uh, is titled "The Wampanoag

888
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,820
and the Native American Side
of Thanksgiving,"

889
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,570
by Evan Fletcher.

890
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,080
"While today Thanksgiving

891
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,870
"is one of our nation's
favorite holidays,

892
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,350
"it has a very different meaning

893
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,260
"for many Native Americans.

894
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,960
"For the Wampanoag,

895
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,060
Thanksgiving is a day
of mourning."

896
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,400
That was beautiful, Evan.

897
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,330
I enjoyed hearing you read it.

898
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,540
As much as I enjoyed
writing it for my blog.

899
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,250
I'm gonna kill
that little asswipe.

900
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,820
If it makes you feel
any better, you'll probably

901
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,480
be killed before you get
suspended for plagiarism.

902
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,780
Scuba. Don't even joke
about that.

903
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,180
Yeah, my bad, you're right.
Plagiarism's serious.

904
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,740
When did you talk to him last?

905
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,490
Two days ago.GABY: Was there a reason?

906
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,530
Yeah, there's a reason.

907
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,320
I never bought Ryan's
Mr. Perfect routine.

908
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,490
Yeah, I mean, how would he
know a random security guard

909
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,150
and why would he not
tell anybody?

910
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,710
I don't know.

911
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,710
Doug just moved here.
He was the new guy.

912
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,410
This guy have any family
in Plymouth?

913
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,020
I think his family's
in Nebraska.

914
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,020
I-I don't believe
for a second it was Ryan.

915
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,720
Doesn't make sense.
He's too nice.

916
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,330
Okay,
let's not be naive here.

917
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,460
I mean, the nicest guys
are the most psycho,

918
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,770
they're just better
at hiding it.

919
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,430
God, what is wrong with me?YULIA: It's not you.

920
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,730
Nothing wrong with you, Jess.

921
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,650
I feel like I can't
trust anybody.

922
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,350
You're probably right.

923
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,040
I mean, us.

924
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,130
It's all we got right now.

925
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,090
And, yes, I am excluding Bobby.

926
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,660
Bobby?
Wh... Bobby would never.

927
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,350
I told you, he was doing great.

928
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,180
No, you told us he told you
he was doing great.

929
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,530
That's different
than he's doing great.

930
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,190
For all we know,
he's not even at school,

931
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,750
and he's driving around
in that tow truck full time.

932
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,620
Wait, hey, hey. Why are we
even talking about them?

933
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,370
It's got to be Mitch. I mean,
he's obsessed with the store,

934
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,280
his wife just died,
and he hates us.

935
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,540
That's right! Yo, that guy's
up to his eyeballs in motive.

936
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,200
And he drives a van:

937
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,980
the official transportation
choice for pedophiles,

938
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,680
kidnappers, rapists,
murderers...

939
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,850
Yep, yep, you're right,
you're right.
Scuba.

940
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,420
Like Coach Ingalls says,

941
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,250
the best defense
is a good offense.

942
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,690
Me and you, we go after them,

943
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,600
fuck them up one by one.Let's go, let's go.

944
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,430
And we'll get some, we'll get
some help from McCarty's store.

945
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:32,080
Guys. Evan. Babe.
This is not a game, okay?

946
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,970
These are not some Hanover kids.

947
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,670
Can we just let the police
handle it, Ev?

948
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,830
We're in deep shit here.

949
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:47,750
We let the police handle it,
we're all gonna end up 50% off.

950
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,670
Are you gonna answer it?

951
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,590
No.

952
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:09,990
This fits.

953
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,560
You're on the Right Mart
"Mayflower"?

954
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,250
Yep.

955
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,430
Next.

956
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,920
Bobby boy.

957
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,100
Forgotten, but not gone.

958
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,360
Forgotten?

959
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,840
It feels like I never left.

960
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,760
You in the parade now?

961
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,990
Yeah, Jess asked me.

962
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,280
Newlon was right, you know.

963
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,930
A lot has changed
since you left.

964
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,150
Ah, maybe not as much
as you think.

965
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,070
What's that supposed to mean?

966
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:48,510
Oh, no, I just mean that I'm
helping with the parade again.

967
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,120
Hmm.

968
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,080
You know, if you weren't
leaving in a few days,

969
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,080
I would knock your teeth out.

970
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,640
Whoa, leaving?

971
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,750
Buddy...

972
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,650
Who says I'm leaving?

973
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,400
You fucking pussy.

974
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,310
You fucking want it.
Let's fucking go.

975

The fuck's going on here?

978
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,190
Come on, Hanover.

979
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:21,890
We gonna carve up Plymouth
like a turkey tomorrow or what?

980
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,540
Let's go! Harder!

981
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,070
Harder! One more time!

982
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:29,030
Fuck yeah!
Looking good, cover girl.

983
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:32,250
Nice. Nice. Nice form, there.
Good shit.

What the fuck?Relax.

1006
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,510
You can't cancel my game!

1007
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,730
You heard the man.
Let's go, Fletcher.

1008
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,470
Game's getting rescheduled.
Let's get changed.

1009
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:10,740
Rescheduled until when?
Until when?

1010
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,520
June?Someone's missing.

1011
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,910
I'm gonna be fucking
graduated by then, bro!

1012
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:14,910
Where you going?I'm gonna go play,

1013
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:16,440
that's what I'm gonna do!

1014
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,130
Dude, you can't play
football alone, dumbass.

1015
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,660
Watch me!

1016
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:24,790
Blunderbuss!

1017
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,490
McCarty, what the fuck
are you doing?

1018
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:28,710
I was just gonna fire it off
if they won the game.

1019
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:30,190
It's just fucking gunpowder,
it's all right.

1020
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:33,240
Sorry, Sheriff.
My kid's a fucking idiot.

1021
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,540
He's a fucking goober chucker.McCARTY'S DAD: Get in the car,

1022
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,890
you fucking idiot.God, I hate those things.

1023
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,200
I can't even smell the powder.

1024
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,330
First commercial
my dad made me do,

1025
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,680
he took it so seriously

1026
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,030
he insisted I learn
how to pack it.

1027
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,330
He made me do it
over and over again.

1028
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,900
Almost blew up in my hand.

1029
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,560
Jess, you should go home.

1030
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,820
Gaby, maybe go find Evan,
get him out of here.

1031
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,040
I heard they found blood.

1032
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,600
Yeah.

1033
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,480
The people missing
were at the Right Mart.

1034
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,960
You stay together,
or at least in pairs, okay?

1035
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,000
Okay, yeah.Shit.

1036
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,570
I'll go get him.Okay, I'll meet you inside.

1037
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,680
Hey, I can leave, you guys.

1038
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,680
Oh, no, no, no.
Let's go back together.

1039
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,070
Hmm? We'll be right back.

1040
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,610
Yeah, wait up.Okay.

1041
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,180
Okay.

1042
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,510
That's weird.

1043
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,210
Gabs.

1044
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,130
Gaby?

1045
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,050
Gaby?

1046
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,120
Help! Help!

1047
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,380
He's in there! Please help!

1048
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,120
Help! Help!

1049
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,950
Please help!

1050
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,220
Did you notice
anything about him?

1051
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:09,010
Um...

1052
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:12,100
He was dressed as a pilgrim.

1053
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,800
And-and he had
a John Carver mask on.

1054
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,840
Okay. Just think.
It's about the details.

1055
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,410
Small mistakes,

1056
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:21,110
that's how they get caught.

1057
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:22,540
I'm sorry, I...

1058
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,630
I only saw him
for a few seconds.

1059
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,290
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's okay. Don't be sorry.

1060
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,160
Okay.Okay, we're gonna get you home.

1061
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,980
You're doing great.Okay.

1062
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,460
Thank you. All right.

1063
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,810
You guys good?Yeah.

1064
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,680
We got to get you guys
home soon, okay?

1065
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,090
Get out of here.

1066
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,430
Hey, Bobby's coming.

1067
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:42,040
Hey, is she...? Hey.

1068
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,870
Are you okay?
Here, here, here.

1069
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:45,910
Thanks.

1070
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,480
That's my girlfriend. Jess.

1071
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,790
He came right for me.Did you see him?

1072
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,440
Hi.RYAN: You okay?

1073
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,790
Yeah. Yeah.

1074
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:56,880
He came after me,
but I got away.

1075
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,010
Douche.

1076
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,280
That's been happening
a lot here recently.

1077
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,930
I wonder why.

1078
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,110
Okay, you want to tell us
about your little buddy,

1079
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,510
the security guard?

1080
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,330
I'm sorry, who?Dude, stop lying to her, man.

1081
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,510
Just like how
you lied to the cops.

1082
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,030
Going to the corner,
huddled together?

1083
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:15,900
I'm sorry, are you talking
about the security guard

1084
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,770
from-from Right Mart? Doug?

1085
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:19,600
We have proof.
It's on video, dude.

1086
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,430
You are a fucking idiot, man.

1087
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:22,990
I honestly hope
you make a better pitcher

1088
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,080
than you do a detective.

1089
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,690
No, I walked off with him

1090
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,350
because we were getting addies.

1091
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:29,260
That's why Scott was there.

1092
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,180
I was just bro-ing up with him
'cause I needed another hookup.

1093
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,880
Adderall?"Adderall?"

1094
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,010
Yes, Adderall.

1095
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,790
That is what smart kids do,

1096
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,050
so we can get into Ivy League
schools, and guys like you

1097
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,660
can tow our Porsches.Get your...

1098
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,360
Bitch!Hey, hey, hey.

1099
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,710
Yo, what the fuck?Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1100
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:45,800
Get the fuck off.Ryan!

1101
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,100
Get home, both of you.

1102
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,150
I didn't...And stay the fuck away

1103
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:49,460
from the parade tomorrow.

1104
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,500
I see either one of you
on the street,

1105
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,020
I'm gonna haul you both in.

1106
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,630
Jess, I'm not the bad guy here.Go.

1107
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,030
He came at me.This isn't done.

1108
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:56,460
He just, he just came at me.No. Stop!

1109
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,070
Stop!

1110
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,990
I can't believe you two.

1111
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,470
My friends could be dead,

1112
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:03,340
and you can't put
your bullshit aside?

1113
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,170
I don't want to see
either of you.

1114
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,950
Okay?

1115
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,300
Get out.Jess, that is not what...

1116
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,790
Get out!

1117
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:13,520
Shit. It's my dad.

1118
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:15,800
Yulia.

1119
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:18,090
Yulia, come.

1120
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,440
I... I...

1121
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,700
Papa. Get in.

1122
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,180
What are you doing? Pop.

1123
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,010
Get in the Mercedes. Dad!

1124
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:27,460
Just tell me where we're going.Florida.

1125
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,240
He's just taking her
to Florida?

1126
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,590
I don't know.

1127
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:36,150
That's about as much
of a conversation

1128
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,630
I've ever had with the guy.

1129
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,720
What?

1130
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,160
Evan's right.

1131
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,770
The police ain't doing shit.
Let's go.

1132
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,250
Where are we going?

1133
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,820
McCARTY:
Ladies and gentlemen,
another satisfied customer.

1134
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,140
Jacob, get him a T-shirt.

1135
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:59,360
Here you go, buddy.
On the house.

1136
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,750
Hey, listen, I just
want to know if it's worth it

1137
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:06,920
before we pay.

1138
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,490
I mean, I heard this party
isn't even all that, so...

1139
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:12,710
Listen, kid.

1140
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:15,020
Sometimes things end up much
better than you'd expect,

1141
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,460
all right?

1142
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,200
Think of it this way,

1143
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,420
when Black Sabbath
fired Ozzy in '79,

1144
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,810
you would've figured
it was all fucking over.

1145
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,330
The end of an era.

1146
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:28,160
But then, along comes
Ronnie James Dio,

1147
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,690
all five foot nothing of him,
the evil little elf,

1148
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,600
and he brought a magic
to that band

1149
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,400
that they hadn't seen in years.

1150
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,620
Who's Black Sabbath?

1151
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:40,090
Get the fuck off my property.

1152
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,700
I just want to know.
Who's Black...

1153
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,610
Get the fuck off
my property right now.

1154
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:45,140
Go back to Methuen,
you fucking dorks.

1155
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,360
Fuck you.No virgins allowed.

1156
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,500
McCARTY:
Cocksucker.

1157
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:52,880
Jacob. VIP. Upstairs. Now.

1158
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:53,940
All right.

1159
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,110
♪ Will he survive, will he
survive, will he survive ♪

1160
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,110
♪ Will he survive the sword? ♪

1161
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,370
Watch out, this kid's
been here for two days.

1162
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:04,990
Drank too much white zinfandel.

1163
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,380
Welcome to the Death Star.

1164
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,210
This is where the magic happens.

1165
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:13,730
Jacob, VIP's closed.JACOB: Yeah.

1166
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:15,310
McCARTY:
You're on door patrol.

1167
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:21,270
You get caught with any of
this shit, you're on your own.

1168
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,130
Jesus, Scuba.What about this?

1169
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:27,960
That's mainly for taking down
angry grizzlies

1170
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,090
in the Alaskan wilderness
or brain-eating zombies

1171
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:33,010
in a post-apocalyptic America.

1172
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,660
All right.

1173
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,850
Let me show you something
far more reasonable.

1174
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,150
.44 Magnum. A classic.

1175
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:45,850
Plus, you get bonus points
if you make

1176
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,370
a Dirty Harry-style comment
when you blast him.

1177
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:50,380
Mc-McCarty, do you have
any human-sized guns?

1178
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,950
Maybe.

1179
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,560
All right.

1180
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,170
The SIG 226.

1181
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:07,260
It's a short recoil-operated,
locked breech pistol.

1182
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,870
Decent stopping power.

1183
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:11,570
You'll want to use this.

1184
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,180
Keep the safety on,

1185
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,140
unless you want
to blow your nuts off.

1186
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,790
What about you, Right Mart?

1187
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:19,620
Uh, I fired a musket once.
It almost killed me.

1188
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,230
Yeah, those things are fucked.

1189
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,330
Let me show you something.

1190
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,930
Check this out.

1191
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,590
Element of surprise, huh?

1192
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:29,850
Pull it out of your belt

1193
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,290
and you stick 'em
right in the gut.

1194
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:32,550
We got all sorts
of tactical shit.

1195
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:34,030
It's yours if you want it.

1196
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:35,990
Um, I'm-I'm good.

1197
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:38,160
Scuba will be with me,
and he's armed, so...

1198
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,960
All right.

1199
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:45,390
McCarty, I owe you one.

1200
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:48,170
Yeah. Anytime.

1201
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:49,960
All right. Thanks.

1202
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,960
Yeah.

1203
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,740
Scuba. Jess.

1204
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,740
Be careful out there, huh?

1205
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,540
Keep yourself alive long enough
to return that thing.

1206
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,530
I don't know what you think

1207
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,060
you're gonna do with a gun.It's for protection, baby.

1208
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,670
You've never even
held one before.

1209
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:07,280
You've never seen one before.

1210
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,410
If you really want someone
to come and help,

1211
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,540
I'm sure my dad can, like,
call the sheriff's department

1212
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,410
and send a cop over.
There's one here right now.

1213
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,760
Hey, can I come by?

1214
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,420
Um, okay, I'm packing right now

1215
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:19,070
'cause I'm going to Florida,
apparently, so...

1216
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:20,940
Okay, I don't know
when I'll be back,

1217
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,860
but I'm a little stressed, okay?

1218
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,210
I'll call you back later.

1219
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:25,860
Okay. Call me from the car.

1220
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,570
Geez.

1221
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,300
For you. Enjoy.

1222
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,220
Thank you. You sure?

1223
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,570
Eat it.
We are going to Florida.

1224
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,090
Appreciate it.

1225
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:41,010
When's the, uh,
the remodel done?

1226
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,880
Never.

1227
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:00,870
Dad?

1228
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,140
Dad?

1229
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,320
Dad?

1230
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:42,980
Dad!

1231
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,770
Jesus, Dad.

1232
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,070
What the hell?

1233
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,870
Car is coming. Finish.

1234
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:53,250
Okay. Trying to.

1235
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:56,920
Fucking contact.

1236
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:01,880
What the hell?

1237
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,400
Yulia!

1238
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:09,280
Dad, I'm coming.

1239
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:18,860
Jesus, what now?

1240
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,060
Hey, baby.

1241
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,590
Hey, what's up?

1242
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:25,460
My dad's, like, freaking out
at me right now.

1243
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,110
We have to leave in, like,
five minutes.

1244
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,590
Okay, yeah, yeah,
no problem, uh...

1245
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:31,200
Okay. Well, I'll call you
from the car.

1246
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,290
I love you.

1247
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,860
Fuck! Fuck!

1248
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:39,040
Scuba, go!SCUBA: No!

1249
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,650
Yulia!

1250
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:42,740
No! Fuck no!Yulia!

1251

No, no, no. No, no, no.

1256
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,200
No, no!

1257
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:18,260
Yulia! Yulia!Yulia!

1258
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,170
Oh, fuck. Yulia!

1259
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,820
Scuba! Hurry up! Hurry!Yulia!

1260
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:26,870
Scuba!

1261
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,220
Yulia!Yulia!

1262
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,260
Scuba, help me.

1263
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:33,750
Let her fucking go.Scuba, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1264
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,880
Let her fucking go, or I'll
blow your fucking head off!

1265
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,400
He has Gaby and Evan.
They're alive.
Fuck.

1266
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,620
What do I do, Jess?Where are they?

1267
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,970
Please, Scuba, please.

1268
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:41,490
Where are they?Jess, what do I do?

1269
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:42,750
I don't know! I don't know!

1270
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:44,580
Listen,
let her fucking go.

1271
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,060
Shoot him.
Shoot him, please, please.

1272
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,370
Let her fucking go!Scuba! Scuba.

1273
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:49,500
Stop!Shoot him! Shoot him now!

1274
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,590
Scuba. Scuba, the safety.

1275
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,200
Take off the safety.SCUBA: Fuck!

1276
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,310
What do I...
what do I do, Jess?

1277
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,370
Jess, what do I do?

1278
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:23,010
It doesn't seem real. I mean,

1279
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:24,620
I-I can't even believe
this is really happening.

1280
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,490
How does this happen
in a place like this?

1281
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:27,890
I mean, is there any...

1282
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:29,500
Like, what are they...
What do you do?

1283
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,240
Somebody need to call SWAT?
I mean, have you ever?

1284
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,670
I mean, maybe we should move.

1285
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,590
I-I don't want to move.
I love this house.

1286
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,550
We're not moving. It's
not even a possibility to move.

1287
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,370
They're not gonna
let me... I-I just need...

1288
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:40,200
I just need...
Give me a couple of seconds.

1289
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,860
I just think
we're all in agreement

1290
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:43,550
that we're not gonna be
participating in the parade.

1291
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,480
I'm with you, Thomas.

1292
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,650
Well, I know I'm not going.
It's too dangerous.

1293
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:52,400
And it's not dangerous
for Gaby and Evan?

1294
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:57,050
You saw what he did to Yulia.

1295
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,270
I can't let that
happen to them.

1296
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:00,790
We have to stop him.

1297
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,830
This parade is our chance
to catch him.

1298
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:05,100
If we hide, then what?

1299
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,060
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life

1300
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,850
looking over my shoulder.
Do you?

1301
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,410
You're right, Jess.

1302
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:15,110
I'm in. Let's do this.KATHLEEN: Look.

1303
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:16,850
Right Mart has extra security,

1304
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,680
so we don't have to worry
about the store. Okay?

1305
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,070
And as far as I'm concerned,
the parade has been decided.

1306
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:24,290
God, I do not want to be
dragged into this any further.

1307
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:25,860
I mean, if you hadn't even gone

1308
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,600
into the store,
this would've never happened.

1309
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,210
Enough, Kathleen.Don't you mean you?

1310
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:30,860
You're the one who wanted
to open the store.

1311
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,950
Nobody was
"Nostra-fucking-damus"

1312
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:34,910
to predict what happened
last year.

1313
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,480
Besides, this year,
I'm closing the store.

1314
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,440
Thanksgiving's a holiday,
even for us.

1315
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,920
Wait, honey, what?

1316
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,050
Kathleen,
it's the right thing to do.

1317
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,630
I made the decision.
It's final.

1318
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,970
Sheriff, is there a way
to set a trap?

1319
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:48,400
Well...

1320
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,140
when the float returns
to the warehouse,

1321
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,930
we can make it
look like it's empty.

1322
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:55,540
Make him think there's
an opportunity to strike.

1323
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,190
And if he takes the bait,

1324
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:58,630
it'll be over
right there and then.

1325
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,200
The bait?

1326
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,590
Excuse me, I don't want us
being used as bait.

1327
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:04,980
We don't finish it now, we'll
be bait no matter where we go.

1328
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:06,300
My daughter's right.

1329
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:12,180
Tomorrow, John Carver
is gonna go down.

1330
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,350
All right, Lionel, turkey time.

1331
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:28,980
Here we go.

1332
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:54,340
I want two people
up here to keep an eye on that.

1333
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,640
Over here as well.
See this whole section?

1334
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,340
Keep an eye on that for me,
will you? Hey.

1335
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,040
Hey.Okay, when you get back here,

1336
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,600
this place is gonna look empty,

1337
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,220
but I'm gonna be here,
and this whole place

1338
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,960
will be crawling
with officers, okay?

1339
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,610
Yup. Thank you, Sheriff.You're welcome.

1340
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:09,350
Hi.

1341
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:11,060
Thank you for coming.Mm.

1342
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,310
You ready?

1343
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:15,270
No.Good.

1344
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:18,190
Me neither. Let's do this.

1345
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:20,670
Okay.

1346
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,030
Hey, Jess.

1347
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,290
Uh...

1348
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:26,760
What's this?

1349
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,020
Oh, it's my dad's ring
from Iraq.

1350
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:30,290
He said it kept him alive.

1351
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:32,390
Uh, i-if you want,
wear it for good luck.

1352
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,650
Thank you.You're welcome.

1353
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:50,930
Happy Thanksgiving!

1354
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:00,750
Hi.

Down with Right Mart!
Down with Right Mart!

1361

What the hell
is going on down there?

1362
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:19,480
It's Mitch.

1363
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,270
Get off the parade route.
Get off!

1364
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:23,660
Get off! Move along.

1365
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,270
Come on, come on.It's nothing. Okay.

Happy Thanksgiving.

1367
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,940
You have a great day.
Happy Thanksgiving!

1368
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:47,730
Happy Thanksgiv...

1369

Grandpa, Grandpa, watch out!

1370

Stop the truck!

1379
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,550
Get us out of here.

1380
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,570

Help me. Please don't kill me,

1405
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,990
Please!

1406
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:48,600
Open the door! Open the...

1407

Please, please don't do this.
Please.

1408
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:52,080
Please, I'm begging you, please!

1409
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,520

No. No! No! No! Please.

1411
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,090
No!

1412
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:05,310
No, please!

1413
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:06,490
No!

1414
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:11,710
No! Please!

1415
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:13,970
No... No!

1416
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:18,720
No! No!

1417
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:32,950
I'm live outside the Plymouth
Sheriff's Department

1418
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:36,390
where outraged citizens
are demanding answers

1419
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:39,430
after a performer was murdered
in broad daylight

1420
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:41,700
at the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

1421
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,310
Flash grenades,
smoke bombs.

1422
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:45,790
I think he's ex-military.

1423
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:47,270
Could be.

1424
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:48,570
There's no way
he's in a civilian car.

1425
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:50,050
Yeah.

1426
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,490
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I-I got something.

1427
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:52,630
What do you got?

1428
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,290
He's live streaming
from somewhere in Cordage Park.

1429
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,640
What the fuck is that?

1430
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,150
Labelle, let's go.

1431
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,160
I'll try to lock the
coordinates in. Calling SWAT.

1432
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,810
I need SWAT and all units
at Cordage Park, immediately.

1433
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:27,310
There's nothing here.
We're in a parking lot.

1434
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:29,530
It's telling me
you're in the exact spot.

1435
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:31,180
I'm telling you,
there's fuck all here.

1436
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:32,400
I don't see nothing.

1437
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,670
This way.Fuck!

1438
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,720
Are there tunnels underneath us?

1439
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:50,110
We'll each take an exit.

1440
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:51,640
Labelle, you take Water Street
and Mayflower.

1441
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:52,720
I'll take Green and Union.

1442
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,120
You guys take Doten Street.

1443
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,730
SWAT's gonna flush him out.
Got it?

1444
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:57,090
Okay? Let's go.

1445
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:03,340
You'll be okay.

1446
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,000
It's gonna be okay.

1447
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:14,790
Go, go, go! Take it down!

1448
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:16,310
On three.Ready?

1449
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:18,230
Two lines, two columns.

1450
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:19,660
Copy.

1451
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:20,840
Go, go. Cover my six.

1452
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:21,970
Copy that.

1453
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:25,970
Closing in on the signal.

1454
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:28,500
Go, go, go!

1455
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,330
Break it in.Copy.

1456
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,200
Did you find them?

1457
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,900
Give me a sitrep.

1458
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,420
Did you find them?

1459
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:45,480
What the fuck?

1460
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,870
It's a fucking monitor.

1461
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:54,670
Damn.

1462
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,200
He's using a new cell.

1463
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,460
Gather 'round.

1464
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:06,970
No, no, no. No.

1465
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:09,450
Gather 'round the table,
everyone.

1466
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:14,860
Dinner is served.

1467
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:28,430
Goddamn.

1468
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:29,910
What the fuck is that?

1469
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:31,650
What the fuck?

1470
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:33,350
Now, is that any way
to thank Kathleen?

1471
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:36,480
She's been cooking all day.

1472
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:46,620
Let's start off the dinner
with a cheer

1473
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:49,930
from our cheerleader.

1474
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,330
Fresh from my wine refrigerator.

1475
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:03,030
She'll pair nicely
with Kathleen.

1476
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:05,420
I'm scared. I'm scared.

1477
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:08,680
You might want to
let that breathe.

1478
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:18,090
So nice to all be together
again on Thanksgiving.

1479
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:20,440
And joining us...Dad!

1480
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,520
Our guest of honor,
Thomas Wright,

1481
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:26,020
who missed last year's fun
sitting in his mansion.

1482
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:30,140
Hmm.

1483
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,580
Now...

1484
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:35,230
we're all going to go
around the table

1485
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:38,320
and say what we're thankful for.

1486
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,070
You're on live,
so choose your words wisely.

1487
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:43,200
Evan.

1488
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,240
No, no, no, no, no. No, Ev.

1489
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,730
Most appropriate that
you go first.

1490
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:52,730
You see, it was your video

1491
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:56,650
that inspired me to make my own.

1492
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:58,040
Okay.

1493
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,560
Evan!

1494
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,780
No.

1495
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:04,520
Help! Help!

1496
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,530
We're-we're in an old house!Let him go!

1497
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:08,480
Let him go!

1498
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,440
So get ready, Evan.No, no, no, no.

1499
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,360
You're about to go viral.Please don't kill me...

1500
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,060
You're going to
break the Internet.

1501
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:17,490
Let him go!No!

1502
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:23,240
No one appreciates subtlety
anymore.

1503
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:24,980
To go viral,

1504
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:27,290
you really need to hit people
over the head.

1505
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:28,550
Right, Evan?

1506
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:36,030
Mm.

1507
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:38,040
Look at all those likes.

1508
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,600
Congratulations, Evan.

1509
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,440
You're a star.

1510
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,440
Now that I have
your attention...

1511
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,310
you're probably wondering
why you're still alive

1512
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:53,490
and they were all killed.

1513
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:55,700
They were just greedy.

1514
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,750
But you...

1515
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,580
you're the VIPs.

1516
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:02,360
It wasn't enough to get
in the store early.

1517
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,580
You had to
taunt everyone outside

1518
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,450
to show them
how special you were.

1519
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:10,370
Well, once this video
goes viral,

1520
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:12,340
everyone will know
how special you are.

1521
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:16,810
Too bad you won't be alive
to see it.

1522
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:20,080
This will be the most famous
Thanksgiving dinner

1523
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,380
since 1621.

1524
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:27,660
And every year,
people will watch this video...

1525
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:30,570
and think of your greed

1526
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:33,490
and the people who died from it.

1527
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:36,720
Now, let's eat.

1528
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,360
Thomas.

1529
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,500
You love your consumers.

1530
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:48,940
Well, tonight's your night
to be one.

1531
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:02,550
Take a bite of your lovely wife

1532
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,960
and show me
how thankful you are.

1533
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:13,220
Show me that you're thankful...

1534
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:14,620
or die.

1535
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:23,110
Oh, fuck!

1536
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:25,270
Go, go, go!

1537
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:27,580
Run! Go!

1538
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:29,320
Go, go, go!Run! Run!

1539
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,710
This way!

1540
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:32,540
Oh, fuck!

1541
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,020
Watch out!

1542
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:35,990
Scuba!

1543
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:39,550
Scuba, this way, this way, go.

1544
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:42,810
It's the Carver House.The door, door.

1545
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:44,170
Jess, go, go, go.

1546
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:50,580
Sheriff?

1547
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,070
Sheriff.

1548
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:44,850
It's me.

1549
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:46,110
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1550
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:47,630
It's Bobby.

1551
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:49,370
It's Bobby. It's Bobby.

1552
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:50,850
He went that way.Okay, get outside, get outside.

1553
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:51,980
Get outside. Just get out.

1554
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,090
Come on.He went that way.

1555
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,880
No. No.

1556
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,130
He's in there.No.

1557
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:09,350
I think I shot him.

1558
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:11,280
No.Then I lost him.

1559
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,180
All clear here.

1560
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:15,400
Check over there.

1561
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:27,450
Oh, sir.
Detective Chu says you need

1562
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:29,720
to turn in your service weapon
since it's been fired.

1563
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,940
Right, right. Yeah, of course.Sorry, pal.

1564
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,850
No, don't worry about it.
I understand.

1565
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:44,210
Sheriff,

1566
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:46,520
we, uh, found this on the floor.

1567
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,040
Still logged
into the John Carver account.

1568
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,190
Thanks, Pete.

1569
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:53,610
It's Bobby's.

1570
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:55,530
We have every police officer

1571
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:57,760
in a hundred-mile radius
searching for him.

1572
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,970
They, uh...

1573
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:05,620
They had to sedate your father
pretty heavily.

1574
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:07,840
He'll be in the hospital a few
days, along with your friends

1575
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,640
Gaby and Scuba.

1576
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:13,770
I'm... sorry
about Kathleen and Evan.

1577
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:19,680
Labelle.

1578
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,200
Chu, see you at the hospital.

1579
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,380
We'll be there in a minute.

1580
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:24,860
See you there.

1581
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,960
We'll see you there, Sheriff.

1582
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:34,400
You're really brave, you know.

1583
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,700
Thank you.

1584
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:40,710
Couldn't have done this
without you.

1585
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:43,840
Can you just give me a minute

1586
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,920
to catch my breath,
and then... and then we can go?

1587
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:47,880
Yeah, sure.

1588
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,070
I'll be right back.

1589
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:20,890
You ready?

1590
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,980
It's about the details.

1591
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:41,550
Small mistakes,
that's how they get caught.

1592
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:43,720
I could really use
your help, Jessica.

1593
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,290
Couldn't have
done this without you.

1594
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:49,070
But you got to be careful
who you trust.

1595
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,820
Jess, you okay?

1596
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:55,820
S-Sorry.

1597
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:58,390
Um...

1598
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:00,960
I'm-I'm not feeling well.

1599
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,010
We'll have a doctor
check you out.

1600
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:05,500
Come on.

1601
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:23,900
If only you'd be stuck
on the fence a second longer.

1602
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:40,430
It's like fumbling
on the one-yard line.

1603
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:45,000
It's almost funny
if you really think about it.

1604
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:52,530
You should see the look
of surprise on your face.

1605
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:55,580
What about Bobby?

1606
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:56,880
Bobby?

1607
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,540
I had him drugged,
dressed up,

1608
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:01,580
ready to be shot,

1609
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:05,190
putting an end to the mystery
of John Carver's identity.

1610
01:32:05,390 --> 01:32:08,590
But when I opened the trunk,
he popped me with a tire iron.

1611
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:10,720
Thankfully,

1612
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,720
you pointed me
in the right direction...

1613
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,550
again.

1614
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:17,770
You've been using me...
this whole time?

1615
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:21,470
When I said, I couldn't
do this without your help,

1616
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:24,180
I really meant it.

1617
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:27,650
Why?

1618
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:31,580
Why... are you doing this?

1619
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:35,140
Mm.

1620
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:39,590
Mitch wasn't the only one
who lost someone that night.

1621
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:45,500
My wife left me,
and Amanda put me back together.

1622
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:47,110
I loved her.

1623
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:49,850
She was gonna leave Mitch.

1624
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:52,250
But then, you and your friends
took her from me.

1625
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:59,350
You took my family from me.

1626
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:05,690
So now, instead of spending
Thanksgiving with Amanda,

1627
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:07,870
I am stuck here in this office.

1628
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:11,000
And now, so are you.

1629
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,310
I'd love to keep chatting,

1630
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:15,350
but now, I got to take care
of some loose ends.

1631
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:16,610
Wait.

1632
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:18,310
I-I didn't get to tell you

1633
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:20,540
what I was thankful for.

1634
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,360
What are you thankful for?

1635
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:27,770
The service in here.

1636
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:42,510
You should see the look
of surprise on your face.

1637
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:44,650
You fucking bitch.

1638
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:57,130
Jess.

1639
01:33:57,330 --> 01:33:59,050
Hey. Come on.Bobby?

1640
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:00,840
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1641
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,540
Hey, come on, come on.Oh, wait. Wait.

1642
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:08,680
Aw, fuck.

1643
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:11,710
Look. Your uncle's truck.

1644
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:13,020
Jessica?!JESSICA: Shh.

1645
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:15,410
Shh. Get down.

1646
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:25,330
Sorry, Jessica.

1647
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:27,810
This year, there will be...

1648
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:31,050
no... leftovers!

1649
01:34:42,670 --> 01:34:45,570
When I told your stepmother,

1650
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:48,850
she would make
an excellent dinner...

1651
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,670
that... was not...

1652
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:55,990
a lie!

1653
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,910
Go.

1654
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:09,350
This way. Come on. Come on.

1655
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:44,500
Oh.

1656
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:57,430
Bobby?!

1657
01:35:59,190 --> 01:36:00,250
Bobby!

1658
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:03,080
No!

1659
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:18,970
Bobby, go!Come on, come on, come on.

1660
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:20,320
It's the... it's the cable.

1661
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,940
I'm trying to drive.
It's not moving.

1662
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,530
Hey, Sheriff, you were right!

1663
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:02,270
No... leftovers!

1664
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:05,930
Jessica!

1665
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:19,550
Roger on unit 121.

1666
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:25,040
Come here.

1667
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:26,780
Take care of yourself.

1668
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:28,210
I'll call you from school.

1669
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:30,300
Be safe.Yeah.

1670
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:33,800
Tell Ryan he's still a dick,
even if he's not the killer.

1671
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:40,010
Oh, Jess.

1672
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:44,580
Hey.

1673
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:46,710
I thought you guys were
at the hospital.

1674
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:48,840
We technically still are.

1675
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,890
We saw the stream.

1676
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:54,150
Detective. We searched
every inch of that place.

1677
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:55,890
Everything was incinerated.

1678
01:37:56,090 --> 01:37:58,160
There's nothing but ash.

1679
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:01,210
No one could survive a blast
like that.

1680
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:41,990
You okay?

1681
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:46,380
