00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,580
That's them in there,
just like that? Just like that.

3
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240

4
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,120
We'll go in there for a day or two.

5
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,191
And the expression kick the hornet's nest?

6
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,061
I'll stay right here, thank you.

7
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,860
Those things scare me to death.

8
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,640
They've been killing my honeybees.

9
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,580
You guys unchecked?
Wipe up the whole colony.

10
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,360
What are you gonna do with them?

11
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,711
Well, that's between me
and them, if you don't mind.

12
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:08,760
That's okay. I understand these things.

13
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,220
I just wanted to thank
you for putting up with me.

14
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,150
And all of my bees.

15
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,120
This place was crabgrass and
weeds, and you brought it back to life.

16
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,570
Well, you're a blessing.

17
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,841
No one's ever taken care of me before.

18
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,660
Well, uh...

19
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:44,470
Mr. Clay, come back at
supper time, let me feed you.

20
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,970
Ross, got something? I got one.

21
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,570
I want it.

22
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,290
I need it.

23
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,450
Hey, free my ear.

24
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,630
Get this fucking ear.

25
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,230
If you shut down, please.

26
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,421
United Data Group, good afternoon.

27
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:04,910
This is Boyd.

28
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,370
How may I help you? Boyd.

29
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,930
Uh, hello.

30
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,570

31
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,970
I just got a message saying that
there's a problem with my computer.

32
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,370
Don't you worry.

33
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,306
The message you received is from our
United Data Group Antivirus Operator.

34
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,290
It's part of the software package
that you pre-installed on your computer.

35
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,210
I'm sorry, I'm not a computer person.

36
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:23,470
What did you say the name
of your product is again?

37
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,720
Now, our records show that you actually
have an older version on your account,

38
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,656
so what I'm going
to need you to do is

39
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:38,880
uninstall that and
install the latest version.

40
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:42,540
I have no idea how to do that.
My daughter set up everything for me.

41
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,540
Well, I would recommend you take
your computer to an IT specialist.

42
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,391
However, keep in mind
that you will lose all your

43
00:05:48,403 --> 00:05:51,060
data since they'll have
to replace the hard drive.

44
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Yeah!

45
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,180
I'm pretty remote out here.

46
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,040
Everything I have is on the computer.

47
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,380
Okay.

48
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,716
There is actually a
software package that you

49
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:32,720
can download that
would allow me to reinstall.

50
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,440
Remotely.

51
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:36,560
Alright. Tell me what to do.

52
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,320
It's okay. Can you type this?

53
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,080
Friendly friend dot net.

54
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,080
Spell it just how it sounds.

55
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,020
Okay. I'm there.

56
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,896
And there should be a button
on your screen that says install.

57
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,200
Again, you click on that button.

58
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
I clicked the button.

59
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,340
So you're about to see
some windows open close on

60
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:57,740
your desktop as I reinstall
the virus shield for you.

61
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,580
Okay! I hope you fucking
clowns are paying attention.

62
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,120
Stick to the script, but not so much
that you sound like a goddamn robot.

63
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,780
Alright?

64
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,260
She has got 10K checking.

65
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:16,920
Life insurance annuity, Roth
IRA, teacher's pension, and...

66
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:19,020
Holy fucking shit! Alright.

67
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,380

68
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:26,000
She is a signatory on a
two million dollar account.

69
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Come on.

70
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,060
This is a fucking charity.

71
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
Alright kids.

72
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,360
Let the script mind him again.

73
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,240
My computer is going crazy.

74
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,980
Totally normal.
Just do not touch your keyboard.

75
00:07:46,895 --> 00:07:50,056
Because of this inconvenience, I'm going
to credit back your subscription fees.

76
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,460
How about that?

77
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,560
I've gone ahead and filed it $500.

78
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,480
It's the account ending 020.

79
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,411
Oh, that's not my account.

80
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,420
That's an account that I manage.

81
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,080
You log into that account and verify
the transfer, please, Miss Parker.

82
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,360
Yes, there's... There's
a transfer of $50,000.

83
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,120
Set the hook.

84
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,260
With sympathy.

85
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,580
Miss Parker, I... I
made a terrible mistake.

86
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,160
I was supposed to credit you for
$500, but I know I got a stuff key here.

87
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,600
I don't know if it's my job here.

88
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
I got kids.

89
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
I got fucking kids.

90
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh, I don't want you
to get in trouble, but...

91
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,500
I could wire the amount back.

92
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,380
I wouldn't need a
different password though.

93
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,160
One second.

94
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:47,200
Now, this is the master
password for all her accounts.

95
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
Okay, so we second.

96
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,780
We get it. We zero out everything.

97
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,610
You know, I... I think
I should call the bank.

98
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,310
You know what? You're probably right.

99
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,470
But there goes my job.

100
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,030
And there goes all your data.

101
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,210
My kids.

102
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,230
Pictures are on this computer.

103
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,630
Okay.

104
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,520
Fucking yes!
That is what I am talking about!

105
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Come on!

106
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:44,824
<b><font color="#60ff00">Subtitle made by Master_Blaster for https://subscene.com/</font></b>

107
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Oh...

108
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,670
What did I do?

109
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,190
Miss Parker? Don't move.

110
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740

111
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,760
Don't you fucking move.

112
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,860
Drop the knife.

113
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
Hands behind your back.

114
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,390
Slowly.
Get on your knees one knee at a time.

115
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,960
Now, who the fuck are you?

116
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,680
And what are you doing in
my mother's house? Verona.

117
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
I'm so sorry.

118
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,740

119
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,920
Well, how do you know him?

120
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,570
The working clear me
is our best and only part.

121
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,820
Clear him?

122
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,560
Agent Parker, I know that's your mother.

123
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,580
I understand that there's a world
where she committed suicide.

124
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,580
Suicide?

125
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,410
You can't be serious.

126
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,140
That woman loved life more than anybody.

127
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:47,800
I know.

128
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,340
But by all means, let's
just completely ignore

129
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:52,420
the big white dude in
her house with a knife.

130
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,060
Get in line.

131
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,690
Come on.

132
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,770
It's Clay, right?

133
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,570
Adam Clay?

134
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,450
I don't know much to say.

135
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,510
Mr.
Clay, we just got a couple of questions.

136
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,050
Like, what the fuck were you
doing in my mother's house?

137
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,650
I wasn't bringing her a jar of honey.

138
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,530
A jar of honey?

139
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,950
Who the fuck are you,
Winnie the Pooh? I keep these.

140
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,630

141
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,530
How do you know my mother?

142
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:24,610
She went some space in the barn from her.

143
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,610
I was signed lease.

144
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,650
But what the fuck were
you doing in her house?

145
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,680
She didn't answer when I knocked.

146
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,450
I knocked at her car in the driveway.

147
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,470
I had to smoke alone when I entered.

148
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,330
You know her.

149
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,470
You're a law enforcement background?

150
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,370
I told you I'd take care of these.

151
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,670
His hands tested negative
for gunshot residue,

152
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,050
but the prints on the
gun were your mother's.

153
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,870
Seems sadly it was suicide.

154
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,710
Mr. Clay, I need you to
apologize for last night.

155
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,110
I realize I may have
been a little aggressive.

156
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,340
That's not understandable.

157
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,270
Could I interest you in
something a bit stronger?

158
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
No.

159
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,710
Or I'll sit with you if you like.

160
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:50,305
I wanted to thank you.

161
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,920
For sitting here in my room.

162
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,596
I tried to stay in her
life as much as I could.

163
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,260
Obviously I could have done a better job.

164
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,980
Being old can be the only thing.

165
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,960
In the same age you used to exist.

166
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,660
She used to matter.

167
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,240
You used to be a part of life.

168
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
For the family.

169
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,600
Or the heart, I guess you could say.

170
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,970
There's some British
Isles hiding in your accent.

171
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,440
I was born that.

172
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,390
I hated that she was out here alone.

173
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
She wouldn't leave.

174
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,660
There's too many memories.

175
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,700
You know, I think I know why she liked you.

176
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,430
You're just like my brother.

177
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,690
He was a Marasaka Marine Raider.

178
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,450
He was killed a few
years ago, kicking doors.

179
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,050
Because she loved him.

180
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Now he'd move on and
you'd think he invented fire.

181
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,230
Meanwhile I graduated the
FBI Academy and she said,

182
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,590
Oh, that's nice.

183
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
She got scammed.

184
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,970
Somebody emptied out all her accounts.

185
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,870
Her savings, her retirement, and
every penny maxed out all her cards.

186
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,430
She was an educator,
director of a charity for kids.

187
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,260
I had two million out of that account.

188
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,670
You know I did it.

189
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,280
I talked to an agent in
our cyber crimes office.

190
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,670
This crew's been operating for two
years and we don't even have names.

191
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,550
And even if we did, good luck building
an indictment that would stand up in court.

192
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,650
Some defense attorney would just
argue that the elderly victim agreed

193
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,380
to wire a complete stranger
his entire life savings.

194
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,290
Taking from an elderly person
is as bad as stealing from a child.

195
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,870
Maybe worse.

196
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,770
Someone that's a child.

197
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,450
Her parents.

198
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,090
People who care are ready to step in.

199
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,170
Someone that's an older person.

200
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,830
Sometimes they'll have
to face the hornets alone.

201
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:09,790
The scenery goes unnoticed.

202
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Well no one cares.

203
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,390
I care.

204
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,070
And I'm stubborn.

205
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,190
And so help me God, I'm going to
get these motherfuckers who did this.

206
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,380
I need to take care of the hive.

207
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,820
You've been up all night.

208
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,340
The hive is more important.

209
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,670
What are you doing?

210
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,270
I thought you were retired.

211
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,070
I did.

212
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,210
I need a favor.

213
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,390
What kind of favor? A name.

214
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,550
A dress.

215
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,990
Easy.

216
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,570
Not easy.

217
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,870

218
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,730
Even the FBI can't find these people.

219
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,310
Well, we're not the FBI, are we?

220
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,090
Show me the deets and stand by.

221
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:21,930
Yeah.

222
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,310
You weren't kidding.
This one kicked my butt.

223
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,450
They're routing all over the world.

224
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,590
But you found them.

225
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,150
Sure.

226
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:29,470
But who are these people?

227
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,810
I want to find out.

228
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,650
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

229
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,270
Now how do you think you're going, pal?

230
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,140
This United Day to whom?

231
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,870
Don't know nothing about that.

232
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,250
This is private property
and you're trespassing.

233
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,190
We're going inside.

234
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,130
I want to burn it down.

235
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,610
Yeah, that's not happening, buddy.

236
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,150
You're not going anywhere except
right the fuck back the way you came.

237
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,100
Do you know what they do here?

238
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,410
Buddy, I'm counting to three.

239
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:03,010
One, two, three.

240
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:03,870
There.

241
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,410
I did it for you.

242
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,750
You aware this is a criminal outfit?

243
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,030
Scamming the weakest in our society?

244
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,770
Stealing everything they have?

245
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,070
Do you know that's who you work for?

246
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,360
Looking for the call center.

247
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,340
Yeah, you're in the right place.

248
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,570
Sign in here.

249
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,260
Tell any of the companies in
the building to evacuate now.

250
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,340
There's going to be a fire.

251
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Okay, thanks.

252
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,020
Hang up the phone.

253
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,320
Oh, I'm good, buddy.
I'm just doing my thing.

254
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,560
Hang up the phone.

255
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,660
Uh, this is Perkins.

256
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,961
So sorry, I don't
want to... You want...

257
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,580
Need your attention, please.

258
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
Beat after me.

259
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,880
I will never steal from the
weak, the vulnerable again.

260
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,400
I think I sent you an important download,
and we'll find out what's going on.

261
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,380
Beat after me.

262
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,460
I will never steal from the
weak, the vulnerable again.

263
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,380
To help you keep that promise.

264
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,870
Now we're going to burn
this place to the ground.

265
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Might be a good time to go home.

266
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Hey!

267
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
Hey, guys!

268
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
You fucking psycho!

269
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,380
Hey, hey, hey!

270
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,980
What's up, bro?

271
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,360
What the fuck you think, bro?

272
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
I'm a beekeeper.

273
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,100
I protect the hive.

274
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,740
Sometimes I use fire to smoke out hornets.

275
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,960
This is a multi-million
dollar operation, asshole.

276
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,200
Okay, so you can't come
up here, white knighting shit.

277
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,050
Will you stop his ass out, please?

278
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,970
I got it, I got it!

279
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,820
You fucking get it, you fucking get it!

280
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,100
Don't you feel really proud of yourself?

281
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,060
Mr...

282
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,920
Garnet?

283
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Mr. Garnet.

284
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,780
I don't care if your
friends hear them or die.

285
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,680
The next call from
your little fishing scam.

286
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,760
This call center will make
a spark across these wires.

287
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,260
I've given all of the
gasoline fumes in here.

288
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,660
I promise you.

289
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:53,240
I think a lot of it won't be.

290
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,920
Guys, we might want to depart.

291
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,420
Flat white, oat milk, of course,
and extra chalice first, of course.

292
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,140
Thank you.

293
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,180
Good morning.

294
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:35,260
Did we get the otoro
and the onion? Yes, sure.

295
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,540
We did.

296
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
Finally, great.

297
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200

298
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,660
Arigatou gozaimasu.

299
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,020
Hey, um, Mikaela.

300
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:43,600
Yes.

301
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,900
It came back, the whole thing?

302
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,860
Yeah, and it's like, I can barely
fucking move, it's all tweaked.

303
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,340
Oh, those are nice.

304
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,160
Those are the new bowls.

305
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Yeah.

306
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
It's perfect.

307
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Thank you.

308
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,800
What?

309
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,220
I'm in a meeting.

310
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,860
You said hit me on voice,
if there's an emergency.

311
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Okay.

312
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,160
Well, uh... It seems we
had a disgruntled customer.

313
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,340
Uh, I just can't comprehend
why you're bothering me.

314
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,920
Just get in touch with the
attorney and start shoving back.

315
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,680
Well, you know, I don't think
that legal's gonna help much.

316
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,340
Okay, so what the fuck
is going on right now?

317
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,580
This dude just scrolls in.

318
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,580
Sam, we're stealing from people.

319
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:33,300
He just tears through.

320
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,580
All my security guys, like
fucking tissue paper, and, um...

321
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
And what?

322
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,620
And he burns the place to the ground.

323
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,120
Yeah, the call center's gone.

324
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,080
I'm standing here staring at a 30
million dollar building that's now, like...

325
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,340
Giant fucking ashtray.

326
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,040
Four people are gonna get out.

327
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,327
You're telling me that
this asshole burned the

328
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:57,480
entire building down and
dropped four fucking bodies?

329
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,856
Yeah, that's not exactly a
disgruntled customer, is it?

330
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,196
Who did this give me a name right now?

331
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,000
I don't have it.

332
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,140
All the other cameras in
the drive burned up in the fire.

333
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
He had a hat.

334
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Oh, he had a hat.

335
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,960
Okay, I'm gonna hit you back, all right?
I gotta go big dog this shit for a minute.

336
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:20,900
Hey, can you talk to him for a while?

337
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,700
What? What? No, nothing.

338
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,040
I mean, if I had a friend who, like, had a
call center and someone burned it down,

339
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,500
maybe killed some people,
you could get him, right?

340
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Get him?

341
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,150
Yeah, like disappear the problem. Come on.

342
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,840
Oh, Vietnam.
That's the way about my favorite.

343
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,148
You, you literally ran
the CIA and you're telling

344
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,140
me you can't just find
some guy in Massachusetts?

345
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,100
Listen, this sounds
like a job for the police.

346
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,820
I just need a name.

347
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,500
Well, you won't get it from me.

348
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,720
And you keep me a million miles away from
your metaverse mess lab or whatever it is.

349
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,580
Yep.

350
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,880
So check it out.
Daddy can't hold your hand on this one.

351
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:02,561
Uh, this is clearly some
kind of crime of passion,

352
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:05,140
spur of the moment, someone
snapped, like, whatever.

353
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,800
But, uh, we're gonna do some ascension
credentials, you're gonna log into our cloud,

354
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,745
and you're gonna look
at anyone connected

355
00:27:10,757 --> 00:27:12,256
to the last few deals
you closed, all right?

356
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,560
Just, I don't know, start there.

357
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,900
And, like, what if I find this guy?
Then what?

358
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,420
You get a wrecking crew
together and you go good, Philazon.

359
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,160
I mean, come on, you're a
connected guy, right? You understand?

360
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,260
Yeah, no, I understand.
I, uh, I'll get it done.

361
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,790
It's called a day off.

362
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,370
Hey, you good?

363
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,710
Yeah, I'm great.

364
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,850
Why? I mean, you did
lose your mother yesterday.

365
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,850
Yeah.

366
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
What do you want, Wiley?

367
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
Are you leaving? There's a lift.

368
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400

369
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,820
Remember United Daddy Group?

370
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,670
Are you sober
enough to drive? Yeah.

371
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,860

372
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,280
Give us a few seconds, thank you.

373
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Where's mine?

374
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,560
It's an old cup for my car with
instant gas-dish and hot water.

375
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:31,680
Ew.

376
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,160
You want some?

377
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
No.

378
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,780
So, fire applied all the CCTV footage.

379
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,740
The reception and session
saw us in jacking this 40's,

380
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,360
manhandled security, and we
walked in with a couple gas cans.

381
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,260
This clown car saw
everything, but no one's talking.

382
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,260
They're all frequent pliers with
perjury, fraud, and side reviews.

383
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,820
Fucking scumbags.
I want ID's on all of them.

384
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,400
You know, this is just
the tip of a 20-spirit group.

385
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,440
Can I just have this
moment? Eloise Parker.

386
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020

387
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,700
Yeah, I took her for
over 2 million yesterday.

388
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,360
She's, uh, she's black.

389
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,040
Widow just has a daughter in Boston.

390
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,120
I don't think this is it, but...

391
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,990
You said your boy has
an old-ass pickup truck.

392
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
That's him.

393
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,050
Then look at those.

394
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,830
What? Fucking beehive.

395
00:29:51,945 --> 00:29:55,390
Yeah, Dickhead was talking about him.
I guess he's a, like, B-E lover.

396
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,290
You know what?

397
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,420
He breaks my shit.

398
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,210
You break his shit.

399
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,620
Fuck!

400
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:49,720
But where you at, B-Boy?

401
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,540
You fucking hiding, bitch?

402
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,340
Well, come here and fucking face us!

403
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,660
Hide, bitch, now!

404
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,620
Let's go!

405
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:16,820
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

406
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,320
Don't let me fucking
help you! Fuck.

407
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
No! I'm okay.

408
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800

409
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420

410
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,840
We, we, we can talk about this.
We can talk about this.

411
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:34,740
Does this point this out, me and you?
We can talk about this.

412
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,940
Fuck you!

413
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,840
Fuck you!

414
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,090
So, help me understand,
because I'm a little confused.

415
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,990
What's the nature of your business?

416
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,730
I don't know nothing about no business.

417
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,990
So then why are people just
wiring you their entire life savings?

418
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,330
It must be your winning personality.

419
00:33:04,331 --> 00:33:07,050
They got us some lawyers,
and they want to talk to them.

420
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,816
You know, this is a really
nice shirt, by the way.

421
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,920
Did you steal that out of a
casket, you dumb fucker?

422
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

423
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:17,651
Corona, if you're done shooting
all over this gentleman's civil rights,

424
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,210
can I speak to you for a moment?

425
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,710
It's a nice shirt.

426
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,190
Yeah.

427
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,170
I know.

428
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,710
I know.

429
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,570
I'm an asshole.

430
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,010
Oh, so you like fires?

431
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,290
Yeah, today I do.

432
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,210
Good, because today's your lucky day.

433
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,390
Apparently, your mother's
house is on fire, too.

434
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,850
And some other shit.

435
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,710
Wait, what?

436
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,290
Yeah, shit's on fire, let's go.

437
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,780
You good?

438
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
Me and you okay? Yeah.

439
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480

440
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,880
That's a new one.

441
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:10,820
Where's Maggie?

442
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Hey, Maggie?

443
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
I did? United Danica.

444
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,650

445
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,070
You know what he's handsome?

446
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Are you okay? Yeah.

447
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,280

448
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,640
While I'm good, I'm good.

449
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:30,240
You think there's even
a remotest chance that

450
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:32,040
the dude can burn down
the magic out of you?

451
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,780
It's the same bad-wrenching
that's fought for your mother.

452
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,460
The V-keeper.

453
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,680
Plus my virginity in that barn.

454
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,610
Fucking shit!

455
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,100
The universe is gonna have to wait.

456
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,080
I'm gonna take this.

457
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,340
Yo, what's up, Leon?

458
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,820
This is the part where you
tell me what a good job you did

459
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:23,280
and I put you on a G6 to
Hawaii to chill for a week.

460
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,360
I'm so sorry, Mr. Danforth.

461
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,200
You fucked this up, are
you fucking crying right now?

462
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,600
I'm not, I'm not crying, I'm bleeding.

463
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,996
Bleeding?
What are you, why are you bleeding?

464
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,060
What do you mean bleeding?

465
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,200
My, my fingers?

466
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,980
Out of my right hand.

467
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
You can cut him off.

468
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,860
Okay, I'll go.

469
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:45,140
Go, go.

470
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,420
He, who the fuck is he?
Tell me who he is right now.

471
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,600
I, I don't know, the
fucking, fucking beekeeper.

472
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,680
Makes honey and it fucks with beehives.

473
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,380
He fucks with beehives?
What's he saying about bees?

474
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:03,460
I don't know, he said he was like
protecting the hive or something.

475
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,100
Oh, fuck, man!

476
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:06,800
What the fuck is this, you guys?

477
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,300
No, no, no, no, no, no,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

478
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,580
What, crypto?

479
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,060
I got fucking an F.D.

480
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,260
Any way, fucker?

481
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,400
No, don't fuck it, man.

482
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
Don't move.

483
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,120
That fucking can't
move! You fucking.

484
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780

485
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,510
You have the pleasure of speaking with her.

486
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,150
Fuck you.

487
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,770
That's who.

488
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,310
You burned up a million
dollar fucking call center.

489
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,550
Now I'm gonna burn you down.

490
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,230
You haven't told me a name.

491
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,950
I told you my name.

492
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,410
It's fuck you, mister fuck you.

493
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:25,651
You better fucking remember it.

494
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,780
Because you don't burn
me down, I burn you down.

495
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,810
You understand me?

496
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,110
You are fucking important
that you cannot comprehend.

497
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,650
You sound young.

498
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,830
I bet you don't have a state punning.

499
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,370
I'm fucking 28 years old.

500
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,450
Why would I need that?

501
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,130
I'm about to show you.

502
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,350
And you say one guy did this?

503
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,270
Yep.

504
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,030
Killed seven armed
men without firing a shot.

505
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,670
And he said he was gonna kill me.

506
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:23,830
And this is your data mining
consumer service business, right?

507
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,750
Yes, something like that.

508
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,030
Pulling in nine million a month,
one office, I've got like 20.

509
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:32,930
Yeah.

510
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:39,110
The only thing you know about
him is he said he's a beekeeper.

511
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,170
Yeah, it's like his
whole brand or whatever.

512
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,350
Jesus.

513
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,370
What?

514
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,437
For someone who has
elevated fucking up into

515
00:38:56,449 --> 00:39:01,350
an art form, this might
well be your Mona Lisa.

516
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,170
How did I fuck up? I don't know.

517
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,010

518
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,750
You've done something.

519
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,370
You've disturbed a beekeeper.

520
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:11,370
Oh.

521
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,710
Oh, okay.

522
00:39:12,711 --> 00:39:13,950
So fucking what?

523
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,370
What I care if the guy keeps bees?

524
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,930
If a beekeeper says you're
gonna die, you're gonna die.

525
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,450
There's nothing I could do
or anybody else to stop it.

526
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,610
So, like, what do you even do here then?

527
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,070
What good are you?

528
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,958
I did 35 years of loyal
government service,

529
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:42,970
culminating as director of the
world's premier intelligence agency.

530
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,390
I could have done anything.

531
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,910
But I chose this job as
a favor to your mother.

532
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,870
Keep Danforth Enterprises safe.

533
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,710
Keep her reputation safe.

534
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,450
Her name safe.

535
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,610
My fucking name too,
all right? Oh, sit down.

536
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,190

537
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,270
I put up with you.

538
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,730
I put up with your tantrums.

539
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,590
Kept you out of the tabloids.

540
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,870
Kept you out of jail.

541
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:10,130
The endless stream of sex workers.

542
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,390
You're a drowning man.

543
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,050
Do you know that?

544
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:17,390
Hmm.

545
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,010
You're scared? Yeah, right.

546
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:19,830
I'm scared.

547
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,950
Terrifying.

548
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:22,890

549
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,330
So should you be.

550
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,250
Wallace, just tell me
what the fuck this guy is.

551
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:37,030
He's probably the last pair of
eyes that you're gonna sneer at.

552
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,060
Okay, listen.

553
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:45,940
Remember our favorite burning building?

554
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
United Data Group.

555
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,460
Guys who work there are hackers,
con men, fraudsters, et cetera, et cetera.

556
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,360
Guy who ran it, Garnet.

557
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,560
He's in the book.

558
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,200
He's a known mob associate.

559
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,020
He's missing, but I've
got PD chasing him down.

560
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,088
Okay, so I had some
analysts run some shit, and I

561
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,120
think I'm starting to get
the shape of the animal.

562
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,660
Dude, I think United Data Group
is one of several call centers.

563
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,807
So there's gotta be
like a central office that's

564
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:12,040
controlling all of them, and
that's what we gotta find.

565
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,780
This could be like a billion
dollar a year operation.

566
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,300
Hello.

567
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,520
Did you hear a single
word I just said? Yeah.

568
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,960

569
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:23,920
And?

570
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,320
Well, I'm just thinking you come
in here, hungover on your day off,

571
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,530
gain more yardage on this thing
than the whole squad has in two years.

572
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,120
Yeah, well, I fucked with my family.

573
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
What'd you get on Clay?

574
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,560
Your beekeeper? Yeah.

575
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:38,820
He's a ghost.

576
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,160

577
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,960
What?

578
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,860
Yeah, all I have is a birth
certificate and a social.

579
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:50,220
You guys never even had a bank
account or credit card flown on a plane.

580
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,980
I ran his prints through every
database I could think of. No hits.

581
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,320
That's bullshit.
This dude is former military all day.

582
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,600
No hits? I'm telling you.

583
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,880
Either he's never been printed
or Adam Clay doesn't exist.

584
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,051
Which is terrifying to me because
he's probably in a classified program.

585
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Speciale Jumali.

586
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,720
Okay.

587
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:16,640
Let's go.

588
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,260
What? They found you.

589
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,000
Can I go now?

590
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:19,720
What? They found you.

591
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,080
Let's go.

592
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Shit.

593
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,220
Jessica.

594
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,580
I think you know why I'm calling.

595
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,840
You know I didn't do anything for you.

596
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Anything.

597
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,740
For you.

598
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,260
Derek's scared shitless.
I've never seen him this scared.

599
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,800
Well, he's made his bet.

600
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,700
I'll give you a board seat on the holding
company that's another million a year.

601
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,140
Plus you promised you'd take care of him.

602
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,960
Look, I don't need that. I have enough.

603
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
So you got this? Yeah.

604
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,320
You have my word.

605
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,680
Wallace.

606
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,780
I still think of you.

607
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,180
Sometimes.

608
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,560
Sometimes.

609
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,870
Why are you calling me on
to never call this limelight?

610
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,790
This is priority one, Janet.

611
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,150
Well, if it was priority
one, I would know about it.

612
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,906
Look, I'm heading downtown
to a POTUS briefing.

613
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:33,930
Just hear me out.

614
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,730
Now, you know who I work
for, don't you? Oh, yeah.

615
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,410
God help you, Wallace.

616
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:38,890
Exactly.

617
00:43:39,335 --> 00:43:42,224
Well, Director Harwood,
my young friend, seems

618
00:43:42,236 --> 00:43:45,010
to have caught the
unwanted attentions of...

619
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:48,430
I have no house to say this of a beekeeper.

620
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,170
Hey, Deb.

621
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:52,910
A beekeeper beekeeper? As in.

622
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,510

623
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:55,990
Well, that's not good.

624
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,330
No, it's not.

625
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,550
When's the body
count? Seven today.

626
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,170

627
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,511
Who is he making funeral arrangements?

628
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,690
I need help, Janet, not jokes.

629
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,460
Is that Garnett?

630
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,300
He's dropped to an old pickle.

631
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,580
Check this out.

632
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,860
Does this mean you've
taken pity on the old man?

633
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,240
So your problem?

634
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,460
He's retired from the program.

635
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:44,730
No longer active.

636
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,540
Well, that changes everything.

637
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,850
The current active
beekeeper is aware of the

638
00:44:51,862 --> 00:44:53,836
issue and is going to be
taking things from here.

639
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,060
You can rest easy, old friend.

640
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,640
Oh, no, Janet.

641
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,247
The current active
beekeeper is a fucking

642
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:01,600
lunatic who should have
been removed months ago.

643
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,980
God help us now.

644
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:44,080
Get out of here!

645
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,460
Shit! Excuse me.

646
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,140
No clue.

647
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,440

648
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,860
No.

649
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,760
You've been a busy bee.
Yours mustn't be retired.

650
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,740
I'm assuming you're my replacement.

651
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,440
No, no, no.

652
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,180
I need your keys.

653
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:33,950
There's an issue.

654
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,581
Problem has not been solved.

655
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,360
Well, that is a surprise.

656
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:47,600
The beekeepers have studied the situation
and have decided to remain neutral.

657
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,760
How did he do that?

658
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,440
He was their man, for fuck's sake.

659
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,340
I'm sorry, Wallace.

660
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,660
You're on your own.

661
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,656
I thought you could fucking handle this.

662
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,780
I can't handle this! Thank you.

663
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440

664
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,740
What you got for us, detective?

665
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,500
That's her vehicle,
registered to Anacet Landris.

666
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:26,740
The ATF will all en route
inbound to take care of it.

667
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,200
We're way cooler than ATF.

668
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,540
I'll show you why I called them.

669
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,330
That's a minigun.

670
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,110
They use those on military vehicles.

671
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,070
Do you know that puppy shoots
6,000 rounds a minute? I know.

672
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:44,970

673
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:46,790
Do you know that's 100
rounds a second? Yep, I know.

674
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,290

675
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,130
Did you know that you
know about it? Yes, I do.

676
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:52,570

677
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,206
It's because I minored in math.

678
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,230
Pretty smart guy.

679
00:49:55,465 --> 00:49:57,350
Okay, then do you know who
Anacet Landris is? Yes, I do.

680
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:58,550

681
00:49:58,730 --> 00:49:59,430
Go ahead and tell me.

682
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:03,110
Someone who doesn't exist in
commercial or government database.

683
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,030
Someone who's a ghost,
like our good friend Adam Clay.

684
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,210
Beekeeping for beekeepers.

685
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:16,650
Here's another reason that Anacet
Landris is like our good friend Adam Clay.

686
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:20,190
Do you know us
that way? Springfield.

687
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,010

688
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,250
Where the call center was torched.

689
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,110
And that way, we're Adam
Clay's headed? Austin.

690
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,530
Let's go.

691
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:34,710

692
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,350
How are you, my friend?

693
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:54,630
Good to see you so good.

694
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:58,250
Come on, make them alone.

695
00:50:58,290 --> 00:50:58,870
Make them alone.

696
00:50:59,110 --> 00:50:59,770
Don't play with those things.

697
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:00,310
They go off.

698
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:01,310
Sit down.

699
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,530
Make yourself comfortable.

700
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:11,950
When I was sworn in as director, I was read
into programs I never imagined existed.

701
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:21,370
Well, there are programs
even I wasn't privy to.

702
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,330
Like the beekeepers.

703
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:27,490
The honey bee.

704
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:31,350
It's always had a special
relationship with humanity.

705
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,010
A sacred relationship.

706
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:38,110
No bees, no agriculture,
no agriculture, no civilization.

707
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,732
Our nation is not unlike
a beehive with its complex

708
00:51:43,744 --> 00:51:47,550
systems of workers,
caretakers, even royalty.

709
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:55,770
If any of the beehive's complex mechanisms
are compromised, the hive collapses.

710
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:02,490
Someone long time ago decided that a
mechanism was needed to keep our nation safe.

711
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:07,710
A mechanism outside the chain
of command, outside the system.

712
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:13,090
It's one mission to keep the system safe.

713
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:20,890
Beekeepers are given all resources
empowered to act on their own judgment.

714
00:52:20,891 --> 00:52:25,810
For decades, they have quietly
worked to keep the hive safe.

715
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,230
That is, until now.

716
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:34,823
It appears that a retired beekeeper
has gone on program and is

717
00:52:34,835 --> 00:52:39,290
acting in what he mistakenly
believes is the hive's best interest.

718
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,100
Can't somebody just pick up a phone and
tell this yah-ho to stand the fuck down?

719
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,430
That's the one thing beekeepers don't do.

720
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:47,850
Stand down.

721
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:54,090
Not unlike bees themselves,
beekeepers keep working until they die.

722
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,690
He's basically one of us.

723
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:58,550
No, he's not like you.

724
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:03,570
You're tier one operators, former
SEAL team six, tell the group.

725
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,190
You are, in other words, pussies.

726
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:12,350
If you were in the same
room, he would kill you.

727
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,157
With enough of you, then
maybe you just might, in fact,

728
00:53:17,169 --> 00:53:21,110
be able to kill him before
he accomplishes his goal.

729
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:22,830
And what would that be?

730
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,970
To kill his way to the top of the hive.

731
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,650
Mr.
Pettis, you should get your people moving.

732
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,060
Dude, bees are interesting
little shits, did you know that?

733
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:47,780
You know, they pollinate a bunch
of shit and we beat fuckers up.

734
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,650
Listen, some bees are queen
slayers, which will rise up and kill

735
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:55,460
their queen if she fails to produce
the right kind of male offspring.

736
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,020
Fascinating.

737
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,480
No.

738
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,840
Nope.

739
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,240
It's your turn.

740
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:11,910
Especially Jim Parker.

741
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,200
Yeah.

742
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,220
Okay.

743
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,300
Thank you.

744
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:22,750
What?

745
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,890
The deputy director is
flying up from DC to see us.

746
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,410
This is your fault.

747
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:16,780
No.

748
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
No.

749
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,621
Here's another interesting factoid.

750
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,120
Thank you, fuck.

751
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,100
You know, I was getting sick of
enjoying my peaceful thoughts.

752
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,680
Sir?

753
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,330
Sir, this is Special Agent
Parker, Special Agent Wiley.

754
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,980
They'll be briefing you.

755
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,500
This is Deputy Director Burke and
Amanda Moon, your special counsel.

756
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,200
Mr. W. Director.

757
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:26,992
My colleague and I believe
that three major crime scenes

758
00:56:27,004 --> 00:56:30,000
in our area are connected to
a single subject, Adam Clay.

759
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:33,270
He killed six people today
based on the extensive

760
00:56:33,282 --> 00:56:35,940
use of trade graft and
the nature of his alias.

761
00:56:36,695 --> 00:56:40,554
We believe that Mr. Clay is connected
to a classified program named Beekeeper,

762
00:56:40,566 --> 00:56:44,140
a program that none of our partner
agencies seem willing to acknowledge.

763
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,220
Let's stick to what we
know, Special Agent Parker.

764
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:48,540
Yes, sir.

765
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,673
In any event, this individual is highly
capable and extremely motivated,

766
00:56:52,685 --> 00:56:56,300
and we believe that he's on his
way to Boston, if not already here.

767
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:01,192
And we believe that this is his next target,
Nine Star United, which appears to be

768
00:57:01,204 --> 00:57:05,760
the entity operating the regional call centers
like the one that Mr. Clay burned down.

769
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,560
Why is Adam Clay on this rampage?

770
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,100
He's protecting the hive, sir.
It's what beekeepers do.

771
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,800
I have enough to brief the director.
What's your ask?

772
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,095
My ask? Well, a
SWAT team, for starters.

773
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:26,740
Surveillance support,
additional agents, analysts.

774
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,060
That shouldn't be a problem.

775
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,820
Thank you.

776
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,800
Did that just happen? Yeah.

777
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:40,940

778
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,284
All right, everybody,
let's help us roll call times.

779
00:57:50,296 --> 00:57:54,040
I'm getting ready for my dick to get hot
with some wonderful beautiful moments.

780
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:58,420
Stop with Phoenix. Where are we at?
Phoenix is off 201K.

781
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,940
201K for the fucking dick. I love you.

782
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,100
Show me. Where are we at?

783
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,420
It's down 93K, boss.

784
00:58:05,421 --> 00:58:07,608
Now, you're a fucking
loser. You give me a

785
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,080
fucking headache, you
give me a fucking cancer.

786
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,620
New York, where do you have it?
I've got the New York City's up 65.

787
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,020
And now you're in New York.

788
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:29,740
We're all weapons front on entry.
We're ready. Come here and do it.

789
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:40,342
Power down, my federal friend. Power down.
The private security here under orders

790
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:44,180
of the governor. State Department certified
to carry weapons in all 50 states.

791
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,960
Feel free to call the
Highlight and I must verify.

792
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,300
You're not welcome here. Put the fuck up.

793
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,760
All right, boys, let's go.

794
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,940
Set up the perimeter outside.

795
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:03,220
We're both taking these loads of money,
money, money. We've got the money.

796
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who the fuck are you? You can't be in here.

797
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,000
We're the guys keeping you alive.
Shut it down now.

798
00:59:12,001 --> 00:59:16,120
Everybody, listen up. Anyone who's
not carrying a weapon, get the fuck out.

799
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,480
As soon as you be killed and live
or something, listen to me, my friend.

800
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,860
This place of Prince's
money, no one's shutting down.

801
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,680
Anybody, so much as puts
a phone down, they're fired.

802
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,480
I'm sorry to break it to you, but
the non's been dead for a while.

803
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,540
So I'm going to say this one last time.

804
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,980
Shut it down. The fuck are you?

805
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,380
I'm calling you a fucking boss.

806
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,960
Anybody call my boss?

807
00:59:39,961 --> 00:59:46,400
I'll do that, and you'll be so fucked.
It's going to be beautiful.

808
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,000
Don't be shy. Come on.

809
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,300
You're about to park in the garage.

810
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,920
Closing lot. Still dating.

811
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,960
You want a body on comms,
watch. Delivery dock? Same deal.

812
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,300
Station in Aginbury too.

813
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,880
You sure there's no back
entrances in this place?

814
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,580
Hey, there's no other entrances.

815
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,621
Federal law enforcement
operation problems.

816
01:00:06,633 --> 01:00:08,740
Move along, minimum
retreat at safe distance.

817
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:15,160
The other option, instead of
going in, is to smoke them out.

818
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,220
Excuse me?

819
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,160
I figured I'd give the
firefighters a break.

820
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,780
I put them through enough already.

821
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,400
But you say your name was?

822
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,580
Currently I'd go by Adam Clay. Trust me.

823
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,940
If it was a back entrance,
I would have used it.

824
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,740
I don't want to injure anyone
who's innocent or not involved.

825
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,840
But it is what it is.

826
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,840
Somebody detain this guy.

827
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,160
Stop!

828
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,280
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

829
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,580
Oh wow, it isn't the fucking
Golden Goose himself.

830
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:19,060
Sir, I got Captain Cape, and he
had told me he sent everyone home.

831
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,760
If we do that, we're walking
away from a lot of money.

832
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:23,860
Put him on.

833
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,120
It's for you.

834
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:29,690
Why are you fucking with
my business? Because Mr.

835
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:32,980
Westwild hired me to kick
some fucking bacon in his ass.

836
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:38,280
Mr. Westwild works for me,
which means that you work for me.

837
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,920
Now listen, that place is the
crown jewel of my kingdom.

838
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,840
I'm not going to let some crash test
dummy with a fucking gun fuck it up.

839
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:46,940
Mr. Pettis.

840
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,720
Didn't this character already burn
running a sentence to the ground?

841
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,740
Well, you know, they didn't have you.

842
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:52,620
And that's why.

843
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:57,060
So maybe you just do your fucking job
and don't tell me how to do mine, please.

844
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,380
We got it.

845
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,440
Copy that.

846
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:01,940
Let's fall out.

847
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,280
Set up a perimeter outside. Let's go.

848
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:06,260
Vile applause.

849
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,240
Let's say goodbye to our beautiful friends.

850
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,960
Bye bye, April.

851
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,720
Go join fucking Space Force.

852
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:15,160
You are beautiful, now get the fuck out!

853
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,940
Keep walking!

854
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,260
Bye bye, dear dad.

855
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,240
Bye, April.

856
01:02:20,241 --> 01:02:21,321
I'm just going to stand up.

857
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,160
Yeah, you're welcome.

858
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:38,870
One time amnesty. Whoever doesn't want to
die this evening can in an orderly fashion.

859
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:40,990
Leave now.

860
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:43,210
No fucking way. It's not happening.

861
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:45,390
Anybody move, you're fired. No bonus.

862
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:46,950
No, no, no, no, no, no.

863
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:48,190
No, no, zero.

864
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:49,370
Okay?

865
01:02:49,371 --> 01:02:50,690
Are you fucking nuts?

866
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:51,970
It's one of these pricks.

867
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:54,130
It's worth 30 to 40
million a year in practice.

868
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:56,750
So no one is shooting no guns.

869
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:59,170
Not a good day to drag
into some people into this.

870
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:01,170
These assholes, they're not innocent.

871
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,550
We're either one of us
to close that distance.

872
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:04,830
Some of them will get hurt.

873
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:06,870
Let's start with this prick right here.

874
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:32,450
Take me!

875
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,040
Paddis, we got a man down.

876
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:23,850
You know who you're working for?

877
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:25,930
I'm not in my fucking business.

878
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,250
I'm just the guy that called
me and there's a problem.

879
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:33,350
You are a problem.

880
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,850
Got them right up a problem.

881
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:49,410
Stop!

882
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:52,010
Stop! Stop! Fire.

883
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:54,950
Fire.

884
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:00,050

885
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:03,980

886
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,000
Dan, what the hell happened?

887
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:17,500
And he's dead?

888
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,760
Not dead, but we got our asses kicked.

889
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,800
Our guy? What do we know?

890
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:22,540
He's in the building.

891
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:24,100
I'm waiting for him to roll in.

892
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,040
I don't know what this guy is,
but nobody can do what he's done.

893
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:28,720
It's just a beekeeper.

894
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,220
But I do.

895
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:33,940
I'm not waiting.

896
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:34,720
Come on, wait.

897
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:35,080
No!

898
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,680
Come on, Wylie, keep up.

899
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,500
Fuck.

900
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,440
You done?

901
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,140
Everybody out!

902
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:43,680
We should take the stairs.

903
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,520
Smart.

904
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,100
Please, please don't kill me.

905
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,780
I'm just a middle manager.

906
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,140
I never had nobody.

907
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:12,060
I respect you more if you look people
in their eyes when you stop them.

908
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,400
Now, you're making a lot of money here.

909
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,600
Tell me where it's all going.

910
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,720
I don't know, man.

911
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,660
I know you're the middle man.

912
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,660
Who's above you? Don't kill me.

913
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,020

914
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,760
I'll torture you then kill you.

915
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,900
Come on, guys.

916
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,040
You got it.

917
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:53,500
Wylie!

918
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,800
Get your ass out here!

919
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,740
Yeah, well, I'm not an Olympian.

920
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,340
Make it stop.

921
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:00,880
You can make it stop.

922
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,404
You've stolen hundreds
of millions from people

923
01:08:04,416 --> 01:08:06,580
who've done nothing but
work hard all their lives.

924
01:08:06,581 --> 01:08:07,581

925
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:15,740
And she was an educator, mom, dedicated
to the whole life to help each other.

926
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:17,661
She was the only person
who took care of people.

927
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:19,980
Yesterday, she shot herself.

928
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,600
She took two million
from a charity she ran.

929
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,651
She was the only person
who ever took care of me.

930
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:37,730
Who and where is the Anzaloni?

931
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:39,670
Tell me who and where.

932
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:40,690
I hear this.

933
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:42,550
Look, these people are untouchable.

934
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:44,210
No, please, please!

935
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,250
I will!

936
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:46,290
I will!

937
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:47,370
Let me show you.

938
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:48,550
Let me show you.

939
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:08,110
I told you they were untouchable.

940
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:11,510
Nobody's untouchable.

941
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:21,350
Sometimes when the hide is out of
balance, you have to replace the queen.

942
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,340
That man is the radio
responsible for your mother's death.

943
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,250
I believe you.

944
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,640
But we have laws for these things.

945
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,240
You have laws for
these things until they fail.

946
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,400
Then you have me.

947
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:01,670
Arrest him!

948
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:04,690
On your feet, properly,
you fucking head up!

949
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:06,850
I just fenced it under
a split glass window!

950
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:07,830
Get your fucking mouth!

951
01:10:07,831 --> 01:10:08,831
No!

952
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,820
That's four kids.

953
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:27,280
I know. Three boys and a girl.

954
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,680
Wylie? Are you okay?

955
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:42,340
Yes.

956
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:43,420
You're okay? You're in LA.

957
01:10:43,421 --> 01:10:43,640

958
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:44,500
Have you been hit?

959
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:48,000
I won't tell her if you've been hit.

960
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:48,860
No, I'm good, Mom.

961
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:49,340
Yeah?

962
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:50,341
Did you get him?

963
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,020
Did you?

964
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,680
No, he was tricking me.

965
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:53,060
Almost.

966
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,040
Okay.

967
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,540
I guess that's just evidence.

968
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,500
Can I borrow your
gun? Yeah, let's go.

969
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:57,820
Or me.

970
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,920

971
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:08,870
I want interviews with all of them.

972
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,540
We're gonna talk.

973
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:18,490
Get him out of here.

974
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:36,830
Wylie.

975
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:58,970
Do you mind if I ask you
a really boring question?

976
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:02,110
Do you actually prefer
the money or the power?

977
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:03,810
Ooh.

978
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:05,370
That's deep.

979
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:06,590
Oh, I'm so sorry.

980
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:07,670
Excuse me.

981
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:10,850
Oh, God.

982
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,166
Would you excuse me for
a moment? Come upstairs.

983
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:14,190

984
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:19,830
You said these guys were the fucking best.

985
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:21,510
Why are they all dead?

986
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:24,950
You kicked the beehive
and now we have to reap.

987
01:12:24,951 --> 01:12:25,951
The whirlwind.

988
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:30,070
Unless...

989
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:32,090
Unless, unless, unless,
unless fucking what?

990
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:35,461
Maybe now's the time to call your mother.

991
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:41,350
I'm paying you so much fucking money
and your advice is to call my mother?

992
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:47,870
He can't make his move on us if we're
in her proximity, can he? Her people.

993
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:49,430
You're a fuck.

994
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:57,550

995
01:12:58,355 --> 01:13:02,450
You're scared and you want to
use my mother as a human shield.

996
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,390
Just call it, just call it, come on.

997
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:06,450
It's not a game.

998
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:08,070
Oh, it's all the game.

999
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:09,910
Come on.

1000
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:11,910
Yes, Derek, what do
you want? Hey, Mom.

1001
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:13,590

1002
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:16,930
No, nothing, I was just, you know,
thinking about you, I miss you.

1003
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:19,330
I was hoping to maybe see you this weekend.

1004
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:21,910
I'm at the beach house, you're
welcome to join if you behave.

1005
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:25,617
I would love to, hey, I'm actually
gonna, you know, get together

1006
01:13:25,629 --> 01:13:28,410
some of my tech homies and
stuff if that's, uh, that's cool with you.

1007
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:32,550
Fine, no drugs, get Kelly the
details, love you, have to go.

1008
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:36,451
Derek's joining me this weekend,
help me keep them sober.

1009
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:37,810
Yes, ma'am, we're babysitting.

1010
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:39,210
Madam President.

1011
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:39,650
Madam President.

1012
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:39,810
Hello.

1013
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:41,590
Hello, good to meet you.

1014
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:43,170
Sola, will you marry me?

1015
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:44,630
Sola, thank you so much for coming.

1016
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:47,610
Susan, I know this way.

1017
01:13:47,611 --> 01:13:48,890
Only right now.

1018
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:49,410
Only right now.

1019
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,610
Only right to meet you.

1020
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,821
You don't have to do this, you know.

1021
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:03,140
Why not let Clay do his thing?

1022
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:07,280
Your mom is dead because of these people.

1023
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:16,910
Wherever it's headed.

1024
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:19,930
I swore an oath.

1025
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,990
Can't stand by and watch it happen.

1026
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:31,450
Even if he's right?

1027
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,940
Even if he's right.

1028
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,300
Apologies, damn plane was delayed.
What have you got?

1029
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:48,720
We think we have a sense
of Mr. Clay's true intentions.

1030
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,560
He seems to be following the money.

1031
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:53,760
What money is that?

1032
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:57,320
Usually it's from people
with no heirs, no family.

1033
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:00,328
Nine Star United uses
data mining software to

1034
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:03,140
identify these people and
then target their assets.

1035
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,940
There's another company involved.

1036
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,110
Sir, a company who is a
vendor to the intelligence

1037
01:15:09,122 --> 01:15:10,820
community and to the
Justice Department.

1038
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,749
In fact, we use this
company's software in

1039
01:15:13,761 --> 01:15:16,720
this very office to
identify financial fraud.

1040
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,016
Are you going to tell me the
name of this company? Ahem.

1041
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:22,580

1042
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:31,200
Danforth Enterprises. With
an annual revenue of $10

1043
01:15:31,212 --> 01:15:35,390
billion, founded and
operated by Jessica Danforth.

1044
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:40,970
Who recently stepped down because she was
sworn in as President of the United States.

1045
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,111
She self-financed
her campaign? Yeah.

1046
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:45,770
None of that money was clean.

1047
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:47,470
Who else knows this? Us three.

1048
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:50,110

1049
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,990
I have a really bad memory, sir.

1050
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:57,910
Let's keep the circle small until I can
read the director and the attorney general.

1051
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:00,030
Not a word of this to
anyone, understood? Yes, sir.

1052
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:00,590

1053
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:03,950
Mr. Clay, I see his kill
count is steadily rising.

1054
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:07,030
In a beehive there is
something called a queen slayer.

1055
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:14,030
It's a bee that will rise up and kill the
queen if she produces defective offspring.

1056
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:16,830
I thought we were sticking
to the known knowns.

1057
01:16:16,831 --> 01:16:22,150
Right, yes, not that beekeepers exist,
but Mr. Clay does keep honeybees.

1058
01:16:22,735 --> 01:16:27,030
He admires their willingness to
sacrifice themselves for the greater good.

1059
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:31,874
Our concern is that
Clay believes that Derek

1060
01:16:31,886 --> 01:16:35,150
Danforth is the defective
offspring of a queen.

1061
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:40,650
Thereby Clay will strike at the heart of
the problem and become a queen slayer.

1062
01:16:43,115 --> 01:16:45,870
Adam Clay's next victim
is Derek Danforth's mother.

1063
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:48,770
President Danforth, sir.

1064
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:52,230
You have a blank check. Good luck.

1065
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:55,790
Thank you.

1066
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:12,270
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1067
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:15,030
This is a private event. I'm going
to need to turn around, go away, fly.

1068
01:17:15,031 --> 01:17:16,749
I don't know if you're
of something or another.

1069
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:18,810
We're good. We
have invites for you.

1070
01:17:18,811 --> 01:17:21,138
All right, you'll need to excuse
my partner who's recently

1071
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:23,771
concussed and hasn't slept in
two days. We're on the access list.

1072
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:25,430
We're good, boss.

1073
01:17:53,865 --> 01:17:56,511
Get the secret service
out of the house.

1074
01:17:56,523 --> 01:17:58,920
They don't want me. They're
cheating. They seem the best.

1075
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:01,860
Uh, Mom's detail is not going to like that.

1076
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,698
Well, if Mom's detail
gets in the way of what's

1077
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:07,340
coming for us, they're
dead men, and so are we.

1078
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:10,651
Tell them they can stay in the kitchen.

1079
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:11,920
Yes, sir.

1080
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:18,020
He has a little talent, doesn't he?

1081
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:19,971
He's absolutely fucking terrifying.

1082
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:23,020
Good man, but clearly not good enough.

1083
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,300
Fuck you!

1084
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:27,080
You're the best
I've got, huh? I do.

1085
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:27,860

1086
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,480
You're looking at me.

1087
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,880
How was any of this my fault?

1088
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:36,020
Wasn't your super secret CIA
data mining software supposed to...

1089
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,016
I don't know, maybe you killed her
out, un-fucking-stop-bull-killing machine.

1090
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,400
Don't you fuck with me, young man!

1091
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,320
Any other life you'll be in jail...
Hey, this is the fucking vicky fuck!

1092
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,160
Yeah, you know I killed one once.

1093
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:51,360
Oh, you see?

1094
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,360
Yeah, only because I was lucky.

1095
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:55,760
And I'm fucking lucky.

1096
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:02,920
Yeah, don't piss your pants, please.
My team will be our short people.

1097
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,040
If anyone can knock this
guy's dick in the dirt, it's them.

1098
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,800
Ain't that right,
money men? Yeah.

1099
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,400

1100
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,810
Madam President, he looks spectacular.

1101
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:58,090
When the fuck are you going to tell
me what's going on, Wallace? Good.

1102
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:03,230
Let's go.

1103
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:06,130
Tell that guy to hurry up.

1104
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:08,830
I want every man on
this street well to shut.

1105
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:10,090
Gotcha.

1106
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:12,290
I want every man on this
street to shut the fuck up.

1107
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:13,790
Good.

1108
01:20:13,791 --> 01:20:15,110
Don't fuck your back, man.

1109
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:17,730
Yeah.

1110
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:19,210
Fix up.

1111
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,800
Feed it up.

1112
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,860
Get your head on it, little gentlemen.

1113
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:26,620
I'm going to draw surprise.

1114
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:38,940
Now.

1115
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:44,780
Save the army.

1116
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:13,530
Open your eyes, please.

1117
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:19,370
Hey, when, uh, when did you get in?

1118
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:20,530
What a surprise.

1119
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,470
You didn't hear the giant marine
helicopter land on the front lawn.

1120
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:27,650
I guess not.

1121
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,290
Is this a nicotine or a carnival, right?

1122
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:34,070
I wouldn't unless you want to
go talk with the machine elves.

1123
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:40,450
Hey, you look fucking great, by the way.

1124
01:22:41,365 --> 01:22:43,250
Power just looks so good on you.

1125
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:45,650
Doing blow on your father's desk.

1126
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:48,890
God, why wish he was
still alive so I could kill him.

1127
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,030
Stop picking your face.

1128
01:22:56,530 --> 01:23:00,050
Why does Wallace Westwad look nervous as a
burning cat? What have you done to the man?

1129
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:02,850
I wouldn't know, Mother.

1130
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:06,350
Well, he's there to
protect you if you'll let him.

1131
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,450
You're a good-looking kid.
You really are, you know that?

1132
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:15,230
What does that mean?

1133
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:19,630
It means that God doesn't
give with both hands.

1134
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:22,990
Okay, I love you too, Mom.

1135
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:26,210
Let it go, run the free world.

1136
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:28,990
Don't burn him down.

1137
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:42,960
Finally, look.

1138
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,580
Oh shit.

1139
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,060
And of course, it looks
like she wants to throw up.

1140
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,540
Mother Biden, bad vibes.

1141
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,960
You got caught right in dirty.

1142
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:56,380
What have we done?

1143
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:59,420
Are you fucking with crypto
at all right now? It's gonna pop.

1144
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:03,140
I think they're minting next week,
so just hit me up on that stuff.

1145
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:03,820
Okay.

1146
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I'll connect your wallet.

1147
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:06,260
Yeah, I'll roll my song.

1148
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,100
Speak to you when I'm deprived.

1149
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:15,690
Uh, who's this?

1150
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,720
Jackson Perk, he's number two with the FBI.
Have a seat.

1151
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:22,076
Oh, I'm cool. I was saying, what is it?
Is it going to ambush or something?

1152
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:22,960
This feels weird. I don't like it.

1153
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,020
No, you'll sit.

1154
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:28,380
I'll sit.

1155
01:25:32,370 --> 01:25:33,731
Kelly, would you give us a moment?

1156
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,056
It's okay, ma'am. I can take notes.

1157
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,200
I need you to step outside.

1158
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,725
The deputy director has
flagged his concerns about some

1159
01:25:47,737 --> 01:25:50,770
uncomfortable things happening
inside the family company.

1160
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:52,510
Why?

1161
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:55,570
Uncomfortable things about
the source of my campaign funds.

1162
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,710
Sound serious? What's up?

1163
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:00,990
Deputy director.

1164
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:05,670
Mr. Davenport, are you
familiar with United Data Group?

1165
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:08,530
United Data Group? Yeah, yeah.

1166
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,930
I invested in that.

1167
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:18,170
I invest everywhere. I mean, there's,
it's everywhere. It's very diverse.

1168
01:26:18,270 --> 01:26:21,810
How about a nine-star United?

1169
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:29,010
Yeah, that was, that's more
of like a consulting-type role.

1170
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:32,590
It's the blockchain issues, and
you might think, don't do that.

1171
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:38,489
What do you know about a
classified, algorithmic, data-mining

1172
01:26:38,501 --> 01:26:42,090
software package developed by
the intelligence community? He's here.

1173
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:57,380

1174
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,360
All stations, targets in the building,
east wing, can be everything you got.

1175
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,640
He's in the house.

1176
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,180
Assault team!

1177
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,260
Saddle down!

1178
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:07,380
Move, boys! Move, boys!

1179
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:13,400
Break, break! Packages in the house!

1180
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,060
Level three, site four!

1181
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:18,240
Blue over blue, you see him!
You fucking get him!

1182
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:21,060
Hey! Put your fucking hands up!

1183
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,380
Now turn the fuck
around! He's outside.

1184
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,120
Target's outside.

1185
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,060
Let's get this fucking guy!

1186
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:38,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1187
01:27:38,781 --> 01:27:39,781
See him? Negative.

1188
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,080

1189
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,200
Hey!

1190
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,240
Test run!

1191
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,300
Test run!

1192
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:47,040
Now!

1193
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:48,560
On your knees!

1194
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:50,140
On your knees!

1195
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,220
Place your fingers behind your head.

1196
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,560
Down!

1197
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:57,840
On your knees!

1198
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,220
Now! Do it, now! Pinky bar.

1199
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:07,750

1200
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:09,650
God's right there.

1201
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:11,350
You aren't shit.

1202
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:12,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1203
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:13,710
Hey, take your step back.

1204
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:16,210
I'm putting this asshole's
brains on the lawn.

1205
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:18,370
What are you doing? Is
that him armed? I'm not.

1206
01:28:18,610 --> 01:28:18,870

1207
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:21,950
As long as this motherfucker's
bleeding his arm.

1208
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:24,030
You're not fucking executing him!

1209
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:25,570
Nice crowd you're on.

1210
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,040
Watch me.

1211
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,520
Hey, what the fuck is going on?

1212
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:40,060
Is it to be or not to be?

1213
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,240
Isn't that the bloody question?

1214
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:44,620
I think I'll take...

1215
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:46,900
to be.

1216
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:55,940
Riley?

1217
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:58,720
Yeah, you good? Yeah.

1218
01:28:58,721 --> 01:28:59,721

1219
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,260
Get off the roof!

1220
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,640
Fucking lie!

1221
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:09,640
Talk to me, people. I need news.

1222
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:19,530
He's here!

1223
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:20,450
No, no!

1224
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:21,670
You're all seated!

1225
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:23,450
You're behind space!

1226
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:24,410
Why are you
waiting? Take it easy.

1227
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:25,570
Take it easy.

1228
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:27,990

1229
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:30,210
Hold your hands,
guys! Hold this off.

1230
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:32,090
You understand.

1231
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,500

1232
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:02,960
You did this, right?

1233
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:03,980
You broke the rules.

1234
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:06,300
You corrupted an imperfect
but functioning sister.

1235
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,320
I was just trying to get
you in your office, Mom.

1236
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:09,660
How did you get elected?

1237
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,700
I was going to win with
or without your help.

1238
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,420
We were already rich.

1239
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,960
Your father built an empire.

1240
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,660
Yeah, and you were gonna fucking
break it up into pieces and sell it off.

1241
01:30:18,661 --> 01:30:21,240
But in the name of public
service, because I care,

1242
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:22,740
I want to leave a better world.

1243
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,080
Okay, right.

1244
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:26,800
Yeah, because you hate
the fact that being the

1245
01:30:26,801 --> 01:30:28,361
president is just like an
endless cocktail party.

1246
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:31,740
You realize that you were behind in
15 of 20 counties you needed to win.

1247
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:33,140
15 of 20 counties.

1248
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:37,440
I taught CIA software to
hunt money and not terrorists.

1249
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:40,480
You didn't hear that.

1250
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,740
You elected because of me.

1251
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:55,580
And you know that.

1252
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:56,760
Yeah, I know it.

1253
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,120
Everyone knows it.

1254
01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:00,220
Now I know where the money came from.

1255
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,800
And all the people you heard.

1256
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:02,620
Okay, whatever.

1257
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,100
It's computer data, Mom.

1258
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,220
Somebody has to have their fucking feet
on the ground to actually get shit done.

1259
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:08,300
You understand that?

1260
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:27,380
Mom, the wolves are at
the fucking door right now.

1261
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:29,220
What are you gonna do
to fix this? Tell the truth.

1262
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:34,270
The fucking.

1263
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:37,350
..

1264
01:31:37,351 --> 01:31:38,650
What does that even mean?

1265
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:41,026
What does that even mean?
Tell the fucking truth!

1266
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:43,370
You have an entire
building full of PR people

1267
01:31:43,371 --> 01:31:45,011
that are gonna choose
the right way forward.

1268
01:31:45,035 --> 01:31:47,290
That guy who's coming
to kill us, that beekeeper,

1269
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:50,050
I'm telling him the truth
about what you did, Derek.

1270
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:51,850
Then I'm telling the entire nation,

1271
01:31:52,030 --> 01:31:53,710
and if it costs me
everything, I'll stop you.

1272
01:31:53,711 --> 01:31:56,480

1273
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:20,220
Get the hell out of here!

1274
01:33:20,221 --> 01:33:22,180
You're just a man.

1275
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:24,240
No, no.

1276
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:40,450
No! No! Thank you.

1277
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,840

1278
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:17,980

1279
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:55,510
Looks like a tornado came through here.

1280
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:02,510
What's your plan here, huh?

1281
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:03,910
You're gonna tell this
guy the fucking truth

1282
01:35:03,911 --> 01:35:05,606
and hope that he spares
you and kills me instead?

1283
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:07,950
No, Derek, I'll tell him the
truth because it's the truth.

1284
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:19,910
It's gone far enough,
you proved your point.

1285
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,530
Beekeepers live for the good of society.

1286
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:26,290
Retired.

1287
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:28,210
This is personal.

1288
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:31,290
All the more reason to stop.

1289
01:35:32,855 --> 01:35:34,550
Go back and live a quiet life,

1290
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:37,010
making honey for your neighbors.

1291
01:35:37,770 --> 01:35:38,770
That's all I wanted.

1292
01:35:40,090 --> 01:35:41,090
The neighbor's dead.

1293
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:43,170
I know, I'm sorry.

1294
01:35:43,570 --> 01:35:45,310
But do you live in the real world,

1295
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:46,690
or just protect it?

1296
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:54,230
What does it matter to you how
presidents come to be elected? It doesn't.

1297
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:56,130

1298
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:58,610
Well, what does matter to you?

1299
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:00,530
Right and wrong.

1300
01:36:01,690 --> 01:36:02,690
It's not fashionable.

1301
01:36:03,890 --> 01:36:05,450
I believe there's good in the universe.

1302
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:07,030
Yeah, well, we agree.

1303
01:36:07,230 --> 01:36:09,530
I mean, that's my view.

1304
01:36:11,035 --> 01:36:12,750
Till the downfall family bought you,

1305
01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:14,810
you would stop pretending.

1306
01:36:16,330 --> 01:36:18,651
We wouldn't need beekeepers
if it wasn't for men like you.

1307
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:20,710
Don't do that.

1308
01:36:20,770 --> 01:36:22,010
So you might want to step back.

1309
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:22,450
No.

1310
01:36:23,170 --> 01:36:24,330
I don't want you to get hurt.

1311
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:26,070
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

1312
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:28,450
Now have a seat.

1313
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:34,410
No, fuck the truth, man.

1314
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:36,230
The truth.

1315
01:36:36,270 --> 01:36:36,850
Wait, wait, wait,

1316
01:36:36,970 --> 01:36:38,290
can you put that down here first?

1317
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:40,710
Jesus!

1318
01:36:41,235 --> 01:36:46,730
That's fucking real right there.

1319
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:55,650
Wait, no!

1320
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:56,870
Drop the weapon! Drop it!

1321
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:14,930
You decide who you work for.

1322
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:17,910
For the law.

1323
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:20,850
Or for justice.

1324
01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:25,390
Hold this.

1325
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:27,350
Goodbye, mom.

1326
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:33,870
No! No! I want my.

1327
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:38,550

1328
01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:39,990
..

1329
01:37:48,190 --> 01:37:49,190
No! I want my.

1330
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:50,060
..

1331
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:51,330
No!

1332
01:37:51,550 --> 01:37:52,550
No!

1333
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:53,850
No!

1334
01:37:54,305 --> 01:38:54,491
