1
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,860
What's wrong?

2
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:07,920
They're foolish.

3
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,990
I just need to be prepared.

4
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,350
Must be buried elsewhere.

5
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,010
elsewhere.

6
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,130
Like what?

7
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,700
I'm gonna love her
more play to help with me.

8
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,160
Yeah!

9
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Science!

10
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
I'm gonna leave you here.

11
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,740
Enter Kamala Khan.

12
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,440
It's ready for... I'm gonna
leave you here with my house.

13
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Shina!

14
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,240
I'm gonna leave you here with me.

15
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:19,330
Christ, I'm just in here.

16
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,406
Because he may have enders me back up here.

17
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,030
I am!

18
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,330
Come back!

19
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,190
This is my chance.

20
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,910
Now that kid, what's your name?

21
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,210
The Marvel Dude.

22
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,230
Tomlinsi.

23
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,110
Hey, you wanna go party with your vendors?

24
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,910
Uh, yeah.

25
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,250
Uh, can you fly?

26
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,210
No, but I can do this.

27
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,870
Ta-da!

28
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,990
I'm gonna leave you here.

29
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,090
Okay.

30
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,430
You don't remember anything.

31
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,930
I see, I see, I see, I see, I see.

32
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:35,931
Flashes.

33
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,030
Little moments.

34
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,710
If I could just piece together what happens
in the morning, maybe it all makes me see.

35
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,590
You stole me, from my home, my family, my
friend, because I've been dead in trouble.

36
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,410
I have for the faster, baby, just me.

37
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,750
Tell us if you're from intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

38
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,050
The war, the lies, all of it.

39
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,610
You can't do this.

40
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,190
I'll be back before you know it.

41
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,570
I can fly up and meet you that way.

42
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:16,850
I only feel it on the globe like
you're not to care about me.

43
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,140
Incoming cold, for me, fear it.

44
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,480
Oh, you expecting a call?

45
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,040
Maybe we just send it to voicemail.

46
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,260
He's next fury.

47
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,540
My favorite one I've made of entry.

48
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,340
They don't stand for us,
prodigal child of the Milky Way.

49
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,120
I'll go with it out there.

50
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:15,815
What the hell was that?

51
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:16,820
No?

52
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,180
Yeah.

53
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,740
What's up?

54
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,520
What about you?

55
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,940
How are you doing?

56
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,580
What do you know about the
surge in the jump point system?

57
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Did you all have to go?

58
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,500
I didn't notice anything
unusual to go in now.

59
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,300
How about the whole system?

60
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,336
We're trying to get a
handle on what happened.

61
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,640
The entire network was affected?

62
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Yeah, end to end.

63
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,213
Thankfully, our neural
network team was able

64
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:40,340
to trace the origin
back to MD for a team.

65
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,240
You're in the neighborhood, right?

66
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:43,241
Yeah.

67
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,580
Are you checking out?

68
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,180
I want it.

69
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,580
Appreciate you.

70
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,351
Monica, our team looks in
more and tells us they're acquired.

71
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,820
Monica?

72
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,440
What's she doing there?

73
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,920
I thought that she was on Earth.

74
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,440
Is she okay?

75
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,780
Yeah.

76
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,810
She's not that little kid you remember.

77
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,050
So, don't we think that we
can finish this before dinner?

78
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,051
Oh, my God.

79
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,010
What if it's in time to get
the reading of the jump point?

80
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,910
Oh, I'm doing so much superpowers and cool.

81
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,310
Oh.

82
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,970
I'm fine.

83
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:29,930
I'm low.

84
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,150
You guys had energy steps up the network.

85
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,250
I gotta find this damage
and see if we can reverse it.

86
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,970
Well, I got that.

87
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Communications override.

88
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,840
Captain Ramville, Space Wolf.

89
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Captain.

90
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,000
Ramville.

91
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,560
What the hell are you doing?

92
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,280
Seems the surge has had some
residual effect on the jump point.

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,760
I'm going to get you
some readings, Fearing.

94
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,160
Hello?

95
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,260
My car.

96
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Hello?

97
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,020
Is that Monica?

98
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
My Carol?

99
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,020
Fearing?

100
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,520
Was that Monica?

101
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,120
Why?

102
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,140
You want to talk to her?

103
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,360
I don't think I'm in the best...

104
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,921
I don't... I don't want...
I don't want... Look.

105
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,876
I don't want to talk to her like this.

106
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,900
Not after all this time.

107
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,480
You know, eventually you're
going to have to talk to her.

108
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,080
I know.

109
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,560
I know.

110
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,560
But say the family reunion
is still on back inside.

111
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,930
I think I found the source of the surge.

112
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,610
What do you see?

113
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,210
It's a jump point, but
it's not closing like...

114
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,750
It's stuck.

115
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,450
Dabbers.

116
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,430
Dabbers.

117
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,590
Dabbers.

118
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:45,400
Jump point is still thinking energy.

119
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Hello?

120
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Hello?

121
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,010
Hello?

122
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,290
Hello?

123
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:13,940
How did you go?

124
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,350
How did you go?

125
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,491
Um... Hi.

126
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,050
How's my good living room?

127
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:40,051
Hello?

128
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,970
Hello?

129
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,510
What is Dabbers doing?

130
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,790
It's too late.

131
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,570
As you find us already on Tommy.

132
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,330
You can't stop this.

133
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:07,580
Fury, it's the Cree.

134
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,120
They're going after this
rolled onto our necks.

135
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,800
Hold on.

136
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,620
Do not go in swinging this
little piece and reconciliation tool.

137
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,660
Fury, I got this.

138
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,760
So I switched with someone
named Kamala Khan?

139
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,100
Yeah.

140
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,980
She seemed to be as confused as you are.

141
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,500
There's nothing in her
power set about teleportation.

142
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,320
Not about her.

143
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't know what happened
to you in me for a while.

144
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,300
Yes, sir.

145
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,320
Uh... I'm not afraid of this.

146
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm not really sure.

147
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,480
Oh, I did not break my closet door.

148
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
Okay, I've seen space.

149
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,400
Oh, I should have broke it, sir.

150
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,500
Oh, no, no, no, no.

151
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:51,880
See, I disappeared.

152
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,560
So maybe Captain Marvel broke it?

153
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,180
What?

154
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
Yes.

155
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,880
Your friend, Captain Marvel,

156
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,020
she's walking up and down our living room.

157
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
And now you come back,

158
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,800
well, sing in with no apologies.

159
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,040
Is there Captain Marvel's in her house?

160
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,100
It's Captain Marvel
pressuring you in any way.

161
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,260
Look, I understand that she's
an important figure and all that,

162
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,880
but you don't have to do it.

163
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,340
No, no, they're clearly working together.

164
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,220
Look at her face and her smile.

165
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,380
She's being super secret.

166
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,420
Always not just looking at her.

167
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:21,860
Mother, you're lying again?

168
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,360
You can tell me.

169
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,036
My daughter has said
she's not going to leave her.

170
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,360
She's having so much fun.

171
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,860
Look at this happening!

172
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,990
This is not what we agreed.

173
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:36,490
See, pram, madame.

174
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,770
The scroll has been scattered
to every corner of the universe.

175
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,390
Made refugees wherever we go.

176
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:48,890
And still, we came into these
negotiations in good faith.

177
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,590
I hate it.

178
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,470
I perhaps more than anyone understand
what you and your people have been through.

179
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,490
After my predecessor was destroyed,

180
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,230
heretics Rose up to filth Lloyd.

181
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,470
The civil war has polluted our skies.

182
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,850
My people cannot breathe.

183
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,030
Our son is dying.

184
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,550
Howler is out of time.

185
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,831
I hope we can rebuild
together so much so that I'm

186
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:21,590
willing to put our ancient
animosities behind us.

187
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,590
and give you a chance
to protect your people.

188
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,410
To stop running.

189
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,900
The scroll will take their rightful
place in the Korean Empire.

190
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,460
And I will aid in a relocation.

191
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:49,065
I would hate for your people to
suffocate when I strip the atmosphere.

192
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,510
Let's see another island!

193
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,960
My son's on some freaky
spaceship and then I teleported here.

194
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,100
I don't know if that's my new powers,
but then that freaky cat ain't a man.

195
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't know if that's gonna go wrong.

196
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,760
It goes come all the way out of the tent.

197
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,560
Oh, no, no, no, no.

198
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
Please rush.

199
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,310
I have to get here and
how are you involved in this?

200
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,850
The Cree jury rigged a wormhole on a 418.

201
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:16,850
Give me like a jump one.

202
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,970
I don't know, but I touched it.

203
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,370
Why'd you do that?

204
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,071
Because I was glowing a mysterious.

205
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,210
Okay, no rule.

206
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,070
No, I'm touching shit.

207
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,910
Especially glowing mysterious shit.

208
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,206
Okay, I'm feeling a lot of negative
energy for me and I don't like it.

209
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,710
That's not the point.

210
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:32,870
The point is, is that it was siphoning
off the atmosphere and it did this.

211
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,190
This is me painting.

212
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:34,610
Cury!

213
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,910
There was like energy
that went around my hand.

214
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,150
Focus!

215
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:38,995
Okay, maybe if I do this.

216
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,670
I don't like that anymore.

217
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,890
I don't like it no more than that.

218
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:00,990
I've got loads of creativity.

219
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,266
I wanted a modified puppets.

220
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,290
I wanna make it point.

221
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,890
Y'all can't do that whole,
doesn't mean it now.

222
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,110
All of that!

223
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,850
A style like it is happening.

224
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,790
315 years later I've seen a pretty big job.

225
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,610
I mean all of that.

226
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:20,910
I'm feeling all of that.

227
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:21,410
I'm feeling it wrong a lot of times
and I'm like... Without my human being.

228
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:21,550
We're alright?

229
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,350
Alright.

230
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,250
I don't like the rock sticks on us.

231
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:33,990
We kick everything,ank everything
We kick everything,ank everything

232
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:37,390
And call it for initiative
Yeah, we're here.

233
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:45,730
Me.

234
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:51,171
And be it again to
Where the fuck you are?

235
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,370
We made it.

236
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:52,350
Let's go slowly.

237
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:53,610
Are you okay?

238
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:54,611
Oh, way!

239
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:03,730
I'lliano when we watchian.

240
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,650
Oh, my God!

241
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,850
Oh, my God!

242
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:17,010
Oh, my God!

243
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:20,690
Oh, my God!

244
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:21,710
Oh, my God!

245
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:22,050
Oh, my God!

246
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,070
Oh, my God!

247
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:23,570
Oh, my God!

248
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,570
Oh, my God!

249
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:28,430
Oh, my God!

250
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,490
Oh, my God!

251
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,710
Oh, my God!

252
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:34,711
No!

253
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,040
Oh, my God!

254
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,490
Come on!

255
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,190
Oh, my God!

256
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,080
Hey!

257
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:31,540
Hey!

258
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:31,580
Hey!

259
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,000
What the?!

260
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:32,620
Are you okay?

261
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
Oh, aah!

262
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,440
Oh, my God!

263
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:43,140
Boy, you're gonna bring it in.

264
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Aah!

265
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,060
I think I switched when I use my power.

266
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,420
A straw Konradic!

267
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Aah!

268
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
Aah!

269
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
I'm still there.

270
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:57,990
I'm going to have you.

271
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,020
Hi.

272
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
Hi again.

273
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,900
I'm so sorry about early early.

274
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,000
We're looking for Kamala Khan.

275
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
No, I'm not there again!

276
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,036
There's just a new
iPad I haven't seen it yet.

277
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,060
I wish.

278
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,040
But if this is all Tom's secret
information, why is it on a clear case?

279
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,180
Well, just swipe it, I love it.

280
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:20,840
Oh, hi.

281
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Can you believe it?

282
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,420
Intel on me?

283
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,940
Believe me!

284
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,740
Hi, I'm Intel.

285
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Oh, my God.

286
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,860
Hey, what does that word stand for?

287
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,520
Strategic aerospace biophysics
and exolinguistic response.

288
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
It's classified.

289
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,260
Sorry.

290
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,420
The heartlight powers, yes.

291
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,360
Okay.

292
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,220
Why do you have Intel on her?

293
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,200
Is there some sort of surveillance on us?

294
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:46,620
The famous is a strong word.

295
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,180
Well, man, your daughter is
the hero of that same Jersey city.

296
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,080
So, of course, we would
have Intel on someone like her.

297
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,400
And you're also
electromagnetically altered.

298
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,360
What does that mean?

299
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,920
Oh, it just means that we
both have light-based powers.

300
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:01,960
What's your?

301
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,460
What's your code, man?

302
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,780
Oh, I don't have a code, man.

303
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,160
Oh, we're choppin'.

304
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:07,161
No, thank you.

305
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,380
I'm Karen.

306
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,320
Captain Marvel also has light-based powers.

307
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,600
Probably not coincidence.

308
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:15,640
Not to mention, the two of
you came into direct contact.

309
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,870
with some malfunctioning jump points.

310
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,040
I still cannot believe
that Captain Marvel

311
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,236
was here and I didn't
even get to meet her.

312
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,856
You know, we're supposed
to be all like twinsies.

313
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,160
You know, we have the same name.

314
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,100
I would obviously then, I don't know,

315
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,881
we just give it the letter that I wrote
for her and we would go out for lunch.

316
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,280
Did you sit on, Carol?

317
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,220
I said that Captain Marvel
can absorb light energy.

318
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,740
I can see it.

319
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:46,320
And you, you can turn light into physical
matter, which I have never heard of.

320
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,040
But my work... I
can totally show you.

321
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
No!

322
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,260
Hi.

323
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Hi.

324
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,600
They don't seem related.

325
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,000
Whatever use of families are complicated.

326
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,220
Monica, you want to build Carolina?

327
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:11,760
Carolina, on your working theory?

328
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,080
Yeah.

329
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,560
Hi, Captain Marvel.

330
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,640
It is so good to see you.

331
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,740
Lieutenant Trouble.

332
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
You too.

333
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
It's Captain Rebel now.

334
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,060
Right.

335
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,740
Sorry.

336
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
So, what's new?

337
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
Where is my sister?

338
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,680
I'm thinking that our joint exposure
to these unsteady jump points

339
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:39,340
and our susceptibility to
electromagnetic energy

340
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,380
has temporarily
entangled our world lines.

341
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,460
Everything.

342
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,980
Entanglement, our light
powers are entangled,

343
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,940
so we switch places whenever
we use them at the same time.

344
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,340
Which would mean Kamala.

345
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,580
What did you get powers?

346
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,700
I walked through a radiation
shielding barrier of a witch hex

347
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,540
and now I can manipulate and see all
wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.

348
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,880
I'm very happy for you.

349
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,060
Where's our doctor?

350
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,720
Yes, please. Where is Kamala?

351
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,580
Where are you?

352
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,620
Where were you?

353
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:08,621
Who's Kamala?

354
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,190
The third person we're switching with.

355
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,960
Light powers, teenage girl.

356
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,020
How are you?

357
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
What are you doing?

358
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,220
I'm trying to switch.

359
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,160
Where is the version?

360
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,060
It's a work.

361
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,520
There are several, please,
tell them how to always switch.

362
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:21,720
Hey!

363
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,800
Where are we going?

364
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Here we go!

365
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,860
Here we go!

366
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:38,320
Oh!

367
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:39,321
Monica?

368
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
You've got to fly.

369
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,880
No, no, no.

370
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,180
I mean, I know.

371
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,936
But technically, I have to take it.

372
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,280
Yeah, well, you got to now.

373
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,680
Oh, Kamala's not going to
graduate from high school.

374
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,400
Come on!

375
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
Here's your car!

376
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,000
Ah, it's cool, it's Carol.

377
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,560
They are associates of Captain Malcolm.

378
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,870
The Annihilator is here.

379
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,470
Yeah, well, she was.

380
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,990
And then these two just sort of appeared.

381
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,270
What about the band?

382
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,190
She's meddling, I need to straighten out.

383
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,650
Yeah, I still can't make out for
these imilitators in today before they...

384
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:49,970
This thing does...

385
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,771
Much more than
just... But it works.

386
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,130
Yes.

387
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,010
Yes, but if you give me
more time, I can make it safe.

388
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,090
No, no, we do it now.

389
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,270
Before the Annihilator appears.

390
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,350
Yeah, what should we do about...

391
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,990
These two?

392
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,890
I can't fly.

393
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,530
Do you guys have a spaceship I can borrow?

394
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:38,160
Mala, don't talk to them.

395
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:50,340
The Cree came here hopeful that
we could build a covenant of peace.

396
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,740
You don't know.

397
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,880
But then you sick the Annihilator on us.

398
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,940
Like we've earned it.

399
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,300
Once again, the Skrull
have betrayed the Cree.

400
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,160
And for that...

401
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:32,710
Okay.

402
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,666
Carol, we gotta give
peace to people out of here.

403
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,690
I'm her, Josh.

404
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,730
We need to evacuate your people now.

405
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,230
We have no way to go.

406
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,680
Carol, just sit.

407
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,790
I need some power so that I can help now.

408
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,710
No!

409
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,060
Charles missions.

410
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,230
It was a ruse.

411
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,710
If it were, your intervention failed.

412
00:34:07,035 --> 00:34:09,470
We don't need your help, any more.

413
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,380
I called a friend.

414
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,541
She can find a safe place for you.

415
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
Is that okay?

416
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,870
We have no choice.

417
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
Incoming.

418
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,230
You're right.

419
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,860
Thank you again.

420
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,680
Always.

421
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,480
I see that you've finally
found yourself a team.

422
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,540
It is unintentional.

423
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,060
No, I've been on some
unintentional teams myself.

424
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,360
I know, but here can stand tall.

425
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
Without standing alone.

426
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,070
Take it from me, Mom.

427
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
Hey.

428
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,451
Councilor Oliver will fix this.

429
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
I promise.

430
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,960
May I next meet you and be joyful.

431
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,260
Breathe.

432
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,520
Do you remember?

433
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,780
When the sun used to shine on her.

434
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,140
How beautiful our home was.

435
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,300
Before her.

436
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,620
Before the annihilator.

437
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,720
I was there.

438
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,100
I heard her lies.

439
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,200
Claiming she was there to set us free.

440
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,460
But when she destroyed
the supreme intelligence.

441
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,480
She destroyed the dream.

442
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,220
For 30 years I have been
fighting alongside you.

443
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,160
Not only have I brought you peace.

444
00:37:33,161 --> 00:37:37,180
But I have found a way
to return hell out of glory.

445
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,560
We need more power than that band
can provide if we to reignite our son.

446
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Then a man of energy.

447
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,640
But it would kill you.

448
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,940
If my life is the cosobia.

449
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,780
We will find the other end times.

450
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,120
There is no more time.

451
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,100
That is out of time.

452
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,010
Need a hand?

453
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
Yeah.

454
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Hey, have me that laser.

455
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
You're micrometers.

456
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,050
Wow.

457
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,830
So you can do that because
you walk through a witching?

458
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,210
Yep.

459
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,450
When I got blipped back they
weren't sending us to space anymore.

460
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,430
Grounded us to investigate
earthbound anomalies.

461
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,950
That must have been hard.

462
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,041
Your mom told you that you
always dreamed of going to space.

463
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,610
They had a lot of proof.

464
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,570
You said you'd be back before I knew it.

465
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,910
What?

466
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,350
When you left.

467
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,310
You said you'd be back before I knew it.

468
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,530
I meant what I said.

469
00:39:21,865 --> 00:39:25,670
I didn't know what I
was getting myself into.

470
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,410
I didn't know what I
explained to a little girl.

471
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,430
A little girl that hung on you.

472
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:31,910
Every word.

473
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,140
If you knew.

474
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:40,360
I was going to come back.

475
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
I just.

476
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,611
There was people that needed me.

477
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
You need to be a girl.

478
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,490
Yeah!

479
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,820
Hey.

480
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:07,960
I hope you don't mind.

481
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,400
I didn't have any other clothes.

482
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,700
It's totally fine.

483
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,780
It looks good.

484
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,880
I knew.

485
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,160
I'm.

486
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:17,161
I'm.

487
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,340
I'm really sorry.

488
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,980
By the way I spoke to you.

489
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Thank you.

490
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,058
I know that this
situation is an ideal, but it

491
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:32,820
is actually nice having
people on board again.

492
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,891
It gets pretty lonely out here.

493
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,560
Anytime you need company I will be there.

494
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,220
I will drop everything.

495
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:40,780
I will.

496
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:42,280
I will drop high school.

497
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,860
Don't do that.

498
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,740
But can't we start again?

499
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,820
Hi.

500
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
I'm Carol Thampers.

501
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,550
I'm Kamala Khan.

502
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,109
But when I'm fighting
crime on the streets of Jersey

503
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,060
City I go by Miss Marvel
and I hope that's okay.

504
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,166
Like copyright wise because honestly
I never thought I'd ever get to be even.

505
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,906
I'm just happening and
we're like touching each other.

506
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,571
I realize I should have asked permission.

507
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,260
So.

508
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,020
Where's the twins?

509
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,240
Okay.

510
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Alright.

511
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,231
Here's what we're going to do.

512
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,560
Captain Marvel.

513
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,100
You need to stop calling me that.

514
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:16,900
I used to change your diapers.

515
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,720
Oh, that was once.

516
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,656
And then I was told you
proceeded to vomit everywhere.

517
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,440
First of all, it's my ship.

518
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,520
So I make the game plan.

519
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

520
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,556
When's the last time you've met a team?

521
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,120
As early as last week.

522
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:26,980
Goose doesn't count.

523
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,360
Please.

524
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,580
You tried giving gooswers.

525
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,740
Like over a team?

526
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,520
No, no, no, no.

527
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:40,780
We're not a team.

528
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,040
Professor Marvel.

529
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,660
Professor Marvel.

530
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:46,620
No.

531
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,680
No, no, no.

532
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,850
She will not.

533
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,940
Thank you.

534
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,511
Now that we've got
that out of the way team.

535
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,331
I've been trying to tell you, I think I
know how she's making the weird jump points.

536
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
She is one of these.

537
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,660
It's my nanny's bangle.

538
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,540
It started glowing really weirdly when
Darwin opened that first jump point.

539
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,380
Also, it once traveled
me through space in time.

540
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,180
It's probably related.

541
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,271
What you're describing is a quantum band.

542
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,170
I mean, I knew there were two of these.

543
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,291
I just did not expect the
other one to be in space.

544
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,380
They're a pair?

545
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,940
How do you have a quantum band?

546
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,320
Okay.

547
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,940
What is a quantum band?

548
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:22,640
A myth?

549
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,220
Or I thought it was a myth.

550
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,900
It's an ancient artifact.

551
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,451
So this is what Darwin
found on that before.

552
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,621
And then her and Kamala just
happened to stumble into each other?

553
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,080
What are the chances?

554
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,000
What you seek is seeking you.

555
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,440
It's inscribed on the bankle.

556
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,910
If the Cree legends are
true, the quantum bands were

557
00:42:41,922 --> 00:42:44,380
used to create every
jump point in the universe.

558
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,000
It's a teleportation network.

559
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,260
Two quantum bands working
in unison to connect the galaxy.

560
00:42:50,755 --> 00:42:53,660
She would now explain our
switchy entanglement situation.

561
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,200
Yeah, yeah, but Darwin only has one.

562
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,200
She must be overloading it with the
energy from her space hammer thingy.

563
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,556
It's called the universal weapon.

564
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:02,920
Oh, really?

565
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,860
I was going to call it Cosmo Rock.

566
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,920
Either way, she is using it to force
unstable jump points into the gray.

567
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,831
We have got to get to her
before she makes another one.

568
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,951
She has star charts and maps
on the screen's ownership.

569
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:15,520
Okay.

570
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,240
To where?

571
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,960
To the stars.

572
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,480
Okay.

573
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,700
It's fine.

574
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,800
I've got one.

575
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,880
We will use this as a
scroll torture device.

576
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,520
Can we put it on our heads?

577
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:29,640
Yes.

578
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,340
It's fine.

579
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,180
You use it to access memories.

580
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:37,020
I've been using it to regain the
memories that the create took for me.

581
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,160
So, yeah.

582
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,180
But, you know, it has a lot of other uses.

583
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,260
It's safe.

584
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,680
You might want to get comfortable.

585
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,020
This is weird.

586
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,260
Wait.

587
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
Go back.

588
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,240
Her band of swords, her
energy and redirects it.

589
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:06,540
It's like you gave her
power to use it against you.

590
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,880
Come on.

591
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,040
What about this?

592
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:12,760
There.

593
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:13,500
Those coordinates.

594
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:14,560
Can you read that?

595
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,080
Yes.

596
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,400
The matchline and galaxy.

597
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,060
All right.

598
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,480
I'll let you tell you.

599
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,900
That you want to go.

600
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,040
You're so cute.

601
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,860
No, wait.

602
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:27,800
No, wait.

603
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:27,860
No, wait.

604
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
No, wait.

605
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,240
Are you asking me to come, Maria?

606
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,780
Oh.

607
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,620
The cancer is back.

608
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,300
So, I need you to take care of Goose.

609
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:43,560
No.

610
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
No.

611
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,840
I mean, you need it once.

612
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,580
You'll need it again.

613
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,820
I'm not taking the cat.

614
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,040
It's not a cat.

615
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,991
It should have been you that day.

616
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,580
That stupid race to the hangar.

617
00:44:56,581 --> 00:44:59,580
I never want her to be Captain Rolfo.

618
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,420
Captain Rolfo sits here just fine.

619
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,480
And it's just until Monica gets back.

620
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,400
She bled me.

621
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,400
Girl, I don't want to relive this.

622
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,680
I'm sorry.

623
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,820
Stop now.

624
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,680
Please, Carol.

625
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,200
Remember why you're out there.

626
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,940
I'll look for a patient around.

627
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:22,500
What are they?

628
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,300
What do you tell them?

629
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,900
Remember to come home.

630
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:26,040
Your mom?

631
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,360
She died honey.

632
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:27,760
No.

633
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,460
No.

634
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:28,860
No.

635
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,280
No.

636
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,540
I'll never do that again.

637
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,040
I'm sorry.

638
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,460
It wasn't on campus.

639
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,620
I'd say your mom passed
away while I was flipped.

640
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,480
When I came back, no one was there.

641
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,350
Okay.

642
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,230
Thank you.

643
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:06,265
She seemed really cool.

644
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:06,940
I'm sorry.

645
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:08,160
She was.

646
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,060
She was the best.

647
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,740
Well, we have to make deal
with what we know right now.

648
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,600
Here is what we do now.

649
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,390
The Universal Neural
Teleportation Network is a

650
00:46:21,402 --> 00:46:23,760
system of wormholes through
the space-time continuum,

651
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,460
AKA junk points, which allows us to
hop between different planetary systems.

652
00:46:28,045 --> 00:46:31,300
Basically, it stretches and reconfigures
space without rupturing the continuum.

653
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,100
Like, cracking.

654
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,086
The more holes you
drill, the more destabilize

655
00:46:36,098 --> 00:46:38,080
the shell becomes,
and then earthquake.

656
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,697
Bottom line, if she
keeps creating these jump

657
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:44,731
points, it's going to get
really bad, really fast.

658
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,580
Question is, what does she want?

659
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:53,020
Tarnax used to be occupied by the
craze, so maybe the attack was a warning.

660
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,331
So she could be after
another former colony?

661
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,200
Is there a former craze
colony in the Magellanic?

662
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:00,180
At one point, the craze
colonized 25% of the galaxy.

663
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,376
If all she wanted was to
destroy Tarnax, why not bring

664
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:07,340
in an armarys of bomb or
something? Why a jump point?

665
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,460
You're right. Jump points aren't weapons.
They're means of transportation.

666
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,637
Every jump point has
two sides, so if it's Tarnax's

667
00:47:13,649 --> 00:47:16,560
atmosphere was siphoned
away, you had to go somewhere.

668
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,960
The Kala?

669
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:23,160
The Cree Civil War basically
bankrupted Hala of its natural resources.

670
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,980
The air is barely breathable.
They're suffering from a drought.

671
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:26,981
A drought?

672
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:28,920
So she could be after water next?

673
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,280
Okay. We're in the Magellanic.
Can we find that?

674
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:36,780
Oceans cover 99.63% of the planet.

675
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,700
That is a very specific step.
You've been there.

676
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,800
No?

677
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,780
Yeah.

678
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,120
She's in there really weird.

679
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,520
Yeah, why are you being weird?

680
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:51,740
Okay. Consensus on Aladdin.

681
00:47:51,741 --> 00:47:52,741
Aladdin.

682
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:59,680
Yeah, I say we do it. Get to Aladdin
and separate Dargan from their bingle.

683
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,400
We have our heading.

684
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:05,560
Kamala, you are not going
on any space adventures.

685
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,840
Nicholas has told me how
dangerous they can be.

686
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,360
It's just fury.

687
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,640
God.

688
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Wait, where are you guys?

689
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,120
Where's Abu?

690
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:20,840
I don't know.

691
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,600
Really?

692
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,660
They insisted.

693
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,800
And your dad is not adjusting
very well to space travel.

694
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:27,540
Hey, babe.

695
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,480
So I'm in this crazy space
elevator and we're going up.

696
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,300
Or maybe we're going down.

697
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,520
Are there directions in space?

698
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,420
Yes, there are.

699
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,760
But no filming.

700
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:45,470
Smile.

701
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:54,830
You've had another series.

702
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:56,970
Reports are coming in across the network.

703
00:48:56,971 --> 00:48:58,410
Seems everyone's been affected.

704
00:48:59,095 --> 00:49:01,513
Oh, we need to stop for
making another one and we can't

705
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:03,910
risk intergalactic bodies
while being in the meantime.

706
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:05,210
This is Khan.

707
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:08,050
I'm sorry, but your daughter
will have to stay aboard by ship.

708
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:08,530
Oh, no.

709
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:09,490
And she'll go into the bottom of this.

710
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:09,870
Yes.

711
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:11,590
You wouldn't let her go.

712
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,970
Mrs. Khan, uh, is not that simple.

713
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:16,730
We need Kamala.

714
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,566
I mean, we found Nani's other bangle
and there's just where they're beautiful.

715
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,131
What kind of terrifying
woman using the other

716
00:49:22,143 --> 00:49:23,626
one are her people
and we have to stop her.

717
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:24,770
They're telling me there's another bangle.

718
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:27,430
And they're going to use
that bangle to hurt you.

719
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:28,931
Monica, go take care of her.

720
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:32,130
We will and we will make sure
she gets back home in one piece.

721
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,750
I promise.

722
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:34,890
Stay the course.

723
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:37,270
We'll figure out how to
close those jumplings.

724
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,870
Kamala, you listen to me.

725
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,110
If anything happens to you, may I
ask you John Loonie, you tell her that.

726
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,230
I love you, Red.

727
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:48,950
I love you more.

728
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,470
Wait, what did she just say?

729
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,050
Nobody cares more than Captain Marvel.

730
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,130
Nobody gets more grief for it.

731
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,930
Trust me, Kamala is in
good hands with Carol.

732
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,570
It's wrong with that cat.

733
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:07,970
It's acting very weird.

734
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,030
Also, Mr. Furish is looking a little pudgy.

735
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,070
I think you're overfeiting her.

736
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,390
Googles.

737
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,300
No!

738
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,000
Firefly.

739
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:24,620
Nightlight.

740
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:25,400
Captain's Marvel.

741
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,760
Mr.'s Marvel.

742
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,920
Doctor.

743
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:29,270
Doctor Bright.

744
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,180
Mmm.

745
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,640
Professor Marvel.

746
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,160
You know us.

747
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:33,780
We know the girls.

748
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,120
Spectromation.

749
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,200
Oh, wait.

750
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:36,440
No.

751
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:40,800
How many times do I have to tell you
guys I do not want or need a code name?

752
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,136
Besides, none of it matters if
we're not coordinated out here.

753
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:44,800
Wanna figure out this one?

754
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,880
Do you think?

755
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,180
I would stay activated after a switch.

756
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:50,260
Good to know.

757
00:50:50,261 --> 00:50:50,840
Okay.

758
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,160
Everyone together on three.

759
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:52,860
Ready?

760
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,480
One, two, three.

761
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,280
Now what?

762
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:56,940
She's saying go.

763
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:57,800
I'm going in three.

764
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,120
I'm going in three.

765
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:09,050
Now.

766
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,650
One, two, three.

767
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:14,010
She gave me eyes.

768
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:18,370
Now.

769
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:20,370
You hold on.

770
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:21,530
One, two, three.

771
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,530
One, two, three.

772
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:29,690
One, two, three.

773
00:51:29,691 --> 00:51:30,630
One, two, three.

774
00:51:30,631 --> 00:51:31,810
One, two, three.

775
00:51:31,811 --> 00:51:32,070
Three.

776
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:34,930
One, two, three.

777
00:51:34,931 --> 00:51:40,890
One, two, three.

778
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,330
That's why you will invest in index
funds rather than in individual stocks.

779
00:51:49,331 --> 00:51:49,570
Of course.

780
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:53,650
Both the Roth IRA and 401K
are important for tax purposes.

781
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:55,466
You know I know we will fool about it.

782
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:55,870
I'm for autonomy.

783
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:56,530
Hey.

784
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:57,930
It's never too late.

785
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:59,190
And it's never too early.

786
00:51:59,470 --> 00:51:59,830
Like I say.

787
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,210
How old are you?

788
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:02,390
26.

789
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:03,150
Wow.

790
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,390
Say name.

791
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,150
What's that?

792
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:09,850
What's that?

793
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:10,070
You have to find out.

794
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:11,370
You have to find out.

795
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:12,650
Can you send us a key?

796
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,570
Sweet thought.

797
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:15,270
Don't touch it.

798
00:52:15,271 --> 00:52:16,271
What is that?

799
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,230
I have a foggiest idea.

800
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:21,530
I'm going to get it.

801
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:22,770
I don't know.

802
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,340
Should we tell fewer?

803
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:29,790
Twenty seconds.

804
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:30,510
To their job.

805
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,686
Do you guys realize how
crazy this is right now?

806
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,630
Like I'm, I'm in a spaceship
with two computers.

807
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,540
Also it's too late to go
to the bathroom because

808
00:52:36,552 --> 00:52:38,006
I feel like it's going
to hit really soon.

809
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,466
No one will believe me like my nephew.

810
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,490
Yes, she would never.

811
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,930
No.

812
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:55,750
No.

813
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,090
No.

814
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:36,430
Okay.

815
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:37,590
Here we go.

816
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:39,210
Combs?

817
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,350
Wow.

818
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:41,871
I've always wanted to eat you.

819
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:43,830
Testing.

820
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:44,850
Testing what you're doing.

821
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:45,330
Mom, what are you?

822
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:45,710
Come on.

823
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:46,711
We hear you baby.

824
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:48,870
Thank you.

825
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,930
So, real quick, before we get sucked in.

826
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,530
What the was that?

827
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:57,110
I should warn you that
I'm kind of famous here.

828
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,381
Well, did you know you're
famous everywhere, right?

829
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,601
This one's kind of different.

830
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,730
I hope the prince with the legal issue.

831
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,170
Okay.

832
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:05,590
Mm-hmm.

833
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,190
Let's go.

834
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:07,390
No matter what.

835
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:08,650
Follow my lead.

836
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:11,263
A lot of culture is
very specific, so there's

837
00:54:11,275 --> 00:54:13,530
going to be a bit of a
ceremony we have to do.

838
00:54:13,531 --> 00:54:14,970
Like, just stay cool.

839
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,290
Hi, small child.

840
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:28,070
Hello.

841
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:29,830
Hello.

842
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,170
As if no time has passed.

843
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:36,090
So exciting that you're home.

844
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,990
Our Princess is home.

845
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,510
Princess.

846
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:44,750
Whoa.

847
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:46,670
Whoa.

848
00:54:47,935 --> 00:54:48,935
It's a technicality.

849
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:50,430
Carol, what is happening?

850
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:51,750
Their language is song.

851
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:53,686
Most of them won't
understand you unless you sing.

852
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:54,710
Come on.

853
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,170
Come on.

854
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:56,510
Let's go.

855
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,090
Let's go.

856
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:58,270
Let's go.

857
00:54:58,410 --> 00:54:58,850
Let's go.

858
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:00,110
Let's go.

859
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:06,650
Let's go.

860
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,130
Let's go.

861
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,230
Let's go.

862
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,010
Let's go.

863
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:11,670
Let's go.

864
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:12,810
Come on.

865
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:18,610
Aren't you like dancing?

866
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,110
I am dancing.

867
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:21,390
And, yes, I am.

868
00:55:21,391 --> 00:55:23,951
Don't think it's the
way that I... Wrong.

869
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:31,830
Ask him if someone... They're
having a... Can you tell anyone?

870
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:38,450
What?

871
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,330
That you're doing with this?

872
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:44,790
So, that's what you meant
when you said legal issue.

873
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:46,590
It is a barrage of convenience.

874
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,030
It's more of a diplomatic act.

875
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:50,831
You know, it's like there's a power
of trouble, a major equal society.

876
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:56,210
We are friends, hmm, it's a long story,
I need to stand, maybe not, we're here.

877
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:22,920
I can't trust, I'm a pleasure to announce
to this lovely room full, two new faces.

878
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:37,011
One could be more
cheerful, but none the last

879
00:56:37,023 --> 00:56:43,160
we ring the bells to
Usher in whole bright days.

880
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,460
And another then, one, two, three.

881
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,860
The marbles!

882
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,020
Yeah!

883
00:56:58,021 --> 00:57:00,120
Well, how is that even a thing already?

884
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,940
I'm kidding, what's really cool?

885
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,240
Where's the Princess?

886
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:20,090
What is she doing? She's respecting us all.

887
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:47,260
So many feelings right now.

888
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,980
Oh, well, I'm a snare afraid of her.

889
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:59,120
If I don't put her feet on the ground, give
me a chance here before it gets over me.

890
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:01,820
So many different things, I don't want.

891
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,400
And trust that you alone
can't stop her alone.

892
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,900
How many chapters have
you kept a Marvel fan fiction?

893
00:58:08,901 --> 00:58:09,901
Is this gonna be him?

894
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,280
So many.

895
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,060
Don't forget.

896
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:14,061
Yeah!

897
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,700
My Princess... Roam the star!

898
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,240
We need to talk.

899
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,580
Okay, let's talk.

900
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,700
Oh wait, he doesn't have the same?

901
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:40,180
Yeah, he's bilingual.

902
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:44,520
We are severely underdressed, but could
you get us something real or bad already?

903
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,380
Of course.

904
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,700
Thank you.

905
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:55,220
Dear itself, our best one of best problems.

906
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,400
A worst enemy plot.

907
00:58:59,205 --> 00:59:00,920
Some kind of infestation by one.

908
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,860
Oh, it could be from a traitor from within.

909
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,640
Well, let's not go there yet.

910
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:11,400
This egg, you say, let's just
continue to study it, if anything.

911
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,840
Morning. 29 new objects.

912
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,340
Detective.

913
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,660
Oh, my gosh.

914
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,540
What about lady of light?

915
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,900
Frequency.

916
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:26,760
Pulsar.

917
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:27,140
No.

918
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:27,840
Pulsar.

919
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:28,640
Light lady.

920
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,940
Absolutely.

921
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,520
These are too much, right?

922
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:40,180
You made us quick.

923
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,680
Nothing grandiose.

924
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,820
Your three engines
disappear, but stay close.

925
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,380
Frustration to you.

926
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:56,410
This will work, beyond.

927
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:01,233
Remember, if you want to
keep unintentional switching

928
01:00:01,245 --> 01:00:03,950
to a minimum, entertainer
as long as you possibly can.

929
01:00:04,505 --> 01:00:07,050
Monica and I will get the jump
on her, and look at the bangle.

930
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:11,610
It's time.

931
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:15,890
Why have you called?

932
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:18,450
I've come here to pardon you.

933
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:20,950
For your crimes against the Korean Empire.

934
01:01:20,951 --> 01:01:21,951
Neil.

935
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:24,290
To you?

936
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,630
I will live with you.

937
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:29,590
Okay.

938
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:16,750
Meet your scarf.

939
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,780
You're too late.

940
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:55,250
Why did you get that?

941
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,490
Grandma!

942
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:06,950
You think that is me in the mail?

943
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:08,970
Get into the car.

944
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:10,710
Right.

945
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:11,910
Get to the ship!

946
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:26,060
Get to the ship!

947
01:04:26,061 --> 01:04:27,061
We've got to see a car.

948
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:35,020
We've got to see a car.

949
01:04:35,021 --> 01:04:41,500
This side is a final system.

950
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,040
Are we doing something about these?

951
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:56,480
The space of the players offline.

952
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,120
We'll come in here with good news.

953
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,400
But don't.

954
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,120
That's not good news.

955
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:38,040
You guys in?

956
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:19,070
Get down here!

957
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,350
You can't hold a thought.

958
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:21,670
Can you hurt this woman?

959
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,020
No, I can lose her.

960
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,840
And what about the other twenty shit?

961
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,880
I can do this.

962
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:17,970
I can't leave now.

963
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:18,390
I can't leave now.

964
01:07:18,391 --> 01:07:19,090
I can't let this happen again.

965
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:20,110
I can't let this happen again.

966
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:20,770
I can do this.

967
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:22,050
And you'll tell us to try.

968
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:24,130
I can't treat you.

969
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:46,011
We left Atlanta to fend for themselves.

970
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:50,070
Darham was going to get my bagel, so
I made a tough call like you did on fire.

971
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:51,270
Don't try to be like me.

972
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:52,850
I messed this whole thing up.

973
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:57,210
If we weren't entangled, if we weren't here,
then you could be Darben and I'm sorry.

974
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,570
No, you don't understand.

975
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:07,330
The crew had been ruled by an AI
for a millennia that led them into a war.

976
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:10,550
I thought the only way
to stop it was to destroy it.

977
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:14,390
But I just made it worse.

978
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:19,210
I'm the reason why the Civil
War started in the first place.

979
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:21,530
I'm the reason why they
couldn't breathe the air.

980
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,661
That's how I got the name in the eye later.

981
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,050
And I never wanted you
to see that version of me.

982
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:34,701
Is that why you never came back?

983
01:08:35,725 --> 01:08:38,550
I thought if I fixed it,
then I could come home.

984
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:44,540
That's not how family works.

985
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:49,940
I never expected you to be
the mighty Captain Marvel.

986
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,520
I just wanted you.

987
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,500
Not what.

988
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:04,431
I'm really glad that you're here now.

989
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,390
And you, too.

990
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,190
I'm glad to be here.

991
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,550
I hope that goes without
saying, and I am sorry

992
01:09:19,562 --> 01:09:22,070
for coming out too
strong at the beginning.

993
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:25,191
I did not give you a lot of
space to be a real person.

994
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:30,630
I have to find her.

995
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:32,610
If anybody should be anywhere.

996
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:33,970
No.

997
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:35,330
Not anywhere.

998
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:38,648
She's targeting the
people that I care about and

999
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,970
stealing resources from
every place I call home.

1000
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:43,190
We have to more fear me.

1001
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:51,350
This is an emergency.

1002
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:55,730
I'll save the person who is reporting
to evacuation time in the field.

1003
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:57,430
What about you?

1004
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:57,810
What about you?

1005
01:09:57,811 --> 01:09:58,430
What about you?

1006
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:02,990
The reason why we have that is to
evacuate 350 personnel of 15 escape homes.

1007
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:05,330
We've seen 5, 10, if you see
there's no one there enough.

1008
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:09,390
We'll fill her in many ones, as many people
as you can, then come up with a plan V.

1009
01:10:09,391 --> 01:10:10,391
Please, operations.

1010
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:16,390
I hope this.

1011
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,060
I hope this.

1012
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,100
I hope this.

1013
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:39,260
Hey.

1014
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,680
That's it.

1015
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,200
It's you.

1016
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,720
Come here.

1017
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:53,780
Hey.

1018
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:55,820
You.

1019
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,880
It's coming.

1020
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,100
It's you.

1021
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,680
Oh, no.

1022
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,560
Oh, no.

1023
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:04,780
We don't need help.

1024
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,060
We don't need help.

1025
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,440
We do.

1026
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:14,360
In the end, one of our students
always hugs us from this life to the next.

1027
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:15,900
What?

1028
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,020
No!

1029
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,780
Could everyone do the evacuation day?

1030
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,440
No!

1031
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:36,590
Can you imagine?

1032
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:41,230
What is going on, fam?

1033
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:42,650
Come on up.

1034
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:43,950
Come on up.

1035
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,030
You're so come on up.

1036
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:46,150
You're not?

1037
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:50,930
You look like a suker and
you're back safely written.

1038
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:52,310
You're not dead.

1039
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,230
I'm lost contact with Earth.

1040
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:56,390
We're officially out of bed and shipping.

1041
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:04,250
No, no, no, no, no.

1042
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,300
That's the plan.

1043
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:07,430
That's the plan?

1044
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:10,970
Much easier to transport a family of
cats than hundreds of crew members.

1045
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:13,511
So we're literally ready, guys?

1046
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,630
Come here, kitty.

1047
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:21,910
Attention, saver groups.

1048
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:22,890
Alright.

1049
01:12:22,891 --> 01:12:23,130
You're still here today.

1050
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:24,131
I'll be right back.

1051
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:32,890
We'll be right back.

1052
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:42,620
What are you doing?

1053
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:31,830
What are you doing?

1054
01:13:31,831 --> 01:13:32,831
Roger, I found her.

1055
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:34,790
Hey, come on.

1056
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:37,770
Drop it.

1057
01:13:37,771 --> 01:13:39,730
it. I'll go.

1058
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:42,770
You've got to lift these home, baby.

1059
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:44,110
How'd it just do?

1060
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:45,090
Come on.

1061
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:45,570
Stop it?

1062
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:58,680
There's a new time of the early days.

1063
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:03,080
It's time for me.

1064
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,280
It's time for you to decide.

1065
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,380
I'm going to be the president of all this.

1066
01:14:11,381 --> 01:14:12,581
I'm going to be the president.

1067
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:22,020
I found our band.

1068
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,920
What? She owns our son.

1069
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:54,070
You leave it again?

1070
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:57,770
Yeah. I mean, the universe is in space.

1071
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:00,750
And if the universe isn't safe,
then we two guys aren't safe.

1072
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:03,150
Listen to me.

1073
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:07,670
You are chosen for a greater purpose, okay?

1074
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,570
So of course you must go now.

1075
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:13,430
That I will never let you cool.

1076
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,750
You understand that, right?

1077
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:20,530
I'm not counting on you.

1078
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:22,430
You could basically be done.

1079
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:23,790
You're better.

1080
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:25,210
I don't want to be a only child.

1081
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:27,410
Not again. Not with these two.

1082
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:33,950
Take his wives, take a
net manual to the bad guy.

1083
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:36,050
Yes, Mr. Fury.
He's trying to give it to me.

1084
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:37,110
I will take it home.

1085
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:39,457
Darwin's opened
another junk plant, and

1086
01:15:39,469 --> 01:15:41,290
we're going to need
both bangles to close it.

1087
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,101
And I guess you better make damn shoes.
You don't get a hands-on.

1088
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:46,170
Understand?

1089
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:23,670
Are you right?

1090
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:25,570
Hey, man!

1091
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:27,590
Hey, man!

1092
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:28,990
Hey, man!

1093
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:30,310
It's a Berry!

1094
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,140
There she is.

1095
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,880
We annihilate the house out.

1096
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,500
It's over, Dark Ben.

1097
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,120
No, I'm not yet.

1098
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,581
I know that you would do
anything to protect Hala.

1099
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:37,380
This will be the end of the Kree.
It will be the end of everything.

1100
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,360
It took for me.

1101
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,120
You're simply repairing your favor.

1102
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,400
Then, give me the bat.

1103
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,580
You're forgetting something?

1104
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,160
What? Me?

1105
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:06,770
This could have been so much easier.

1106
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:09,790
I don't know. I like our eyes.

1107
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:25,760
Get out of here!

1108
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:04,640
No!

1109
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:32,620
You're living up to your name again.

1110
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:35,300
I didn't want this.

1111
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,260
That seems to fully shoot.

1112
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,560
It doesn't have to end like this, Dark Ben.

1113
01:19:46,561 --> 01:19:47,940
Please, just give us the bangle.

1114
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:49,060
We're what?

1115
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:52,600
Hollis don't die because of you.

1116
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:54,860
Why shouldn't you repass?

1117
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,940
Maybe she should.

1118
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,540
The reaction in your son's core has slowed.

1119
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:05,376
And he's an incredible amount
of energy to jump-starting.

1120
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,680
And that's what you have, Carol.

1121
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,420
You can use your powers to save Hala.

1122
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:14,040
I've never done anything like that before.

1123
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:17,260
In the last couple of days, I have done
a lot of things I've never done before.

1124
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
But you got this.

1125
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:27,050
For Hala.

1126
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,270
Try to knock you much
faster than you can make.

1127
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:21,550
I won't survive this, Dark Ben.

1128
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:23,270
Listen to me.

1129
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:13,890
I need to show you.

1130
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,900
So what are we looking at?

1131
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:05,980
We're self-propagating singularity with
negative mass and non-Newtonian topology.

1132
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,920
She tore a hole in space-time.

1133
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,880
That is a different
reality, leading into ours.

1134
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,460
You can even fix that in theory.

1135
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:23,140
You and Carol can reproduce the same
amount of energy that was used to open it.

1136
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:26,580
I will absorb it and then release
it, but from inside the tear.

1137
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,160
But what about the switching?

1138
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:30,720
Our powers aren't entangled anymore.

1139
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,840
Oh.

1140
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:36,360
Well, that's a good thing, I guess.

1141
01:23:38,455 --> 01:23:41,058
But wait, you want us to
blast you with the same amount

1142
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:43,780
of power that punched a hole
in the fabric of space-time?

1143
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:46,220
If we want to UN-punch it.

1144
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Yeah.

1145
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:52,000
I'm gonna need this.

1146
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,920
How are you feeling, Ms. Marvel?

1147
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,020
These bagels are all but
there's space and time to find me.

1148
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:10,680
I was born for this.

1149
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:16,180
It has to be now.

1150
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,110
Ms. Marvel.

1151
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:05,990
It's closing, Monica.

1152
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:07,311
Monica, you gotta get out of her.

1153
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:29,480
Come on, you saved the world.

1154
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,480
Why are you praying?

1155
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:15,910
We lost Monica.

1156
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,561
She couldn't stop on the other side.

1157
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:23,840
And Carol.

1158
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,160
We went to some full promise.

1159
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:54,420
How would things?

1160
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,643
This is kitchen, but
there are these hot

1161
01:30:28,655 --> 01:30:31,070
sauce bar tips and
then there's this veneet.

1162
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:34,110
This is our looking tray, which I will say.

1163
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:36,070
It's a very good quality though.

1164
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:37,090
Oh, you can give it.

1165
01:30:37,330 --> 01:30:37,990
Oh, no, no, no.

1166
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:39,670
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1167
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:40,890
It works for me.

1168
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:44,970
The vastness of it just gives you
a whole new perspective on life.

1169
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:46,941
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1170
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:48,810
And it was surprisingly cool.

1171
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:53,950
This place is amazing.

1172
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:55,910
Yeah, it is.

1173
01:30:58,150 --> 01:30:59,591
Hey, did you stop flying that thing?

1174
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:00,910
You want to check it out?

1175
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:02,010
Thank you.

1176
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:03,810
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1177
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:05,250
Come here, come here, come here.

1178
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,210
Oh, I'm so happy that
you won't save the door.

1179
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:20,791
Ahmed, it's gonna be a lovely
house to raise a family in, you know?

1180
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:23,340
Ahmed.

1181
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:24,820
This is so cool.

1182
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,000
All right, let's see, it's all you.

1183
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:37,640
What's the last thing?

1184
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:39,971
I actually don't know the key.

1185
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:42,240
I'm just looking after it.

1186
01:31:44,935 --> 01:31:46,416
She doesn't want to get against back.

1187
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:47,960
Yeah.

1188
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:51,000
Just until Monica gets back.

1189
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:53,700
I really miss her.

1190
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,580
We're good together.

1191
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:58,060
She got me thinking.

1192
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:11,900
Pizza delivery.

1193
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,560
Can I help you?

1194
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:26,910
Kate Bishop.

1195
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,281
Did you think you were the
only kid superhero in the world?

1196
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:35,520
23.

1197
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:36,720
Oh, I know.

1198
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:38,501
I've been running up on you.

1199
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,520
Where did you fit that?

1200
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:41,740
I found out of my couch.

1201
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:43,500
Okay.

1202
01:32:43,610 --> 01:32:45,491
You just become part of
a much larger universe.

1203
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:50,560
Which, at the moment, is just me, mostly?

1204
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,176
I do have your lips out there.

1205
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,276
Did you know Ahmed had a daughter?

1206
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:53,720
What do you want?

1207
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:55,460
I'm putting together a taking.

1208
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:57,450
I know when you want it.

1209
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:04,680
Please.

1210
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:46,230
Mom, I've missed you so much.

1211
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:48,570
I'm so sorry.

1212
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:50,350
I'm not.

1213
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,060
I'm not a mysterious visitor.

1214
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:58,560
She's single disoriented.

1215
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:00,500
Where are we?

1216
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:02,380
What happened?

1217
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:04,100
We were hoping you could tell us.

1218
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:06,760
All we know is that binary found.

1219
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:08,620
My theory?

1220
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,280
You somehow crossed through.

1221
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:11,700
You were like terror in space time.

1222
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,780
You are now in reality
parallel to your own.

1223
01:36:16,030 --> 01:36:17,620
Which is, of course, impossible.

1224
01:36:21,390 --> 01:36:23,500
You think that we have
a confusion happening?

1225
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:26,960
Confusion is but the first step
on the journey to knowledge.

1226
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:29,740
I'll take it for you.

1227
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,340
Charles asked for an update.

1228
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:34,791
I'll combine and check out you later.
